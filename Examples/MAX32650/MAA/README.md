## Description

This example demonstrates the Modular Arithmetic Accelerator feature of the Trust Protection Unit.

In this particular example the MAA is configured to compute an exponentiation. The result of the MAA calculation is compared to the expected result.

*** NOTE ***: The MAA is only enabled for the MAX32651, not the MAX32650.

## Required Connections

-   Connect a USB cable between the PC and the CN2 (USB/PWR) connector.
-   Open an terminal application on the PC and connect to the EV kit's console UART at 115200, 8-N-1.

## Expected Output

The Console UART of the device will output these messages:

```
***** MAA Example *****
...
```
