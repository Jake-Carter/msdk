For beginners, learngitbranching.js.org is a great hands-on starting resource. Contribution Guidelines The MSDK follows the GitHub contribution guidelines . External contributions from outside the Analog Devices organization should be made via a Pull Request opened from a fork. Internal contributions should also preferrably use a fork where possible. If a direct branch on the mainline MSDK repo is made, the following branch naming conventions should be used when possible: Bugfix/ticket: fix/ticketnumber New feature: feature/branchname Generic development branch: dev/branchname New and/or modified example branch: example/branchname PR Title - Subject Responsibilites for Reviewers/Mergers/PR Owners Format: type(scope)<!>: Subject For more information of the format, please review the pull_request_template.md . These are the rules for the Subject . The first character is capitalized and the subject must not end with any punctuation (!,.?) Use imperative mood in the Subjects - meaning the tone of the Subject should be like giving an order or request. \u201cAdd\u201d instead of \u201cAdded\u201d or \u201cAdding\u201d. \u201cFix\u201d instead of \u201cFixed\u201d or \u201cFixing\u201d. \u201cUpdate\u201d instead of \u201cUpdated\u201d or \u201cUpdating\u201d. \u201cDelete\u201d instead of \u201cDeleted\u201d or \u201cDeleting\u201d. The Subject contents should have useful and concise wording. No long descriptive subjects - not concise if it gets too descriptive. You can be more descriptive in the body or footer of the commit by running: git commit -m \u201cTitle contents\u201d -m \u201cBody contents\u201d -m \u201cFooter contents\u201d No simple titles like \u201cAdd small SPI change\u201d The Subject should include what parts are affected, if any. Only the parts\u2019 CHIP NAME should be used in the Subject. No die names are allowed. For the most readability, append the affected parts list at the end of the Subject, so the important, beginning part of the commit message is visible when traversing through the MSDK repo on GitHub. The list of chip names should be in ascending numerical order in the Subject. Examples: fix(CMSIS): Rename TRIMSIR registers for MAX32670 and MAX32675 fix(Third-Party): Remove USB DMA support for MAX32655, MAX32665, MAX32690, MAX78000, and MAX78002 feat(Examples): Add console output in Hello_World READMEs for all parts fix(Examples,PeriphDrivers): Deprecate MXC\\_RTC\\_GetSecond and MXC\\_RTC\\_GetSubSecond for all parts except for MAX32520 Use this type of wording if all but a few parts were affected to shorten the Subject. TIP : The auto-labeler workflow adds part labels to a PR depending on what specific files were updated. Use the list of labels to figure out what parts were affected by the PR's changes. If the PR title is related to a Jira ticket or an issue, the Subject should begin with the ticket designation. Examples: fix(CMSIS): MSDK-123: Add missing I2C Target registers for MAX32670, MAX32672, and MAX32675 fix(PeriphDrivers): Ticket-321: Fix SPI hanging on 9-bit wide messages for all parts fix(Documentation): Issue #123: Revise steps for MSDK installation in the user guides When a merger \u201cSquash and Merges\u201d an approved PR to main, do not delete the PR number that is automatically appended to the title. Ideally, the PR title should be following our rules before approval, so the merger just needs to press the \u201cSquash and Merge\u201d button. Using previous examples from rule 4, this is what the commit should look like in the main branch: fix(CMSIS): MSDK-123: Add missing I2C Target registers for all parts (#412) fix(PeriphDrivers): Ticket-321: Fix SPI hanging on 9-bit wide messages for all parts (#646) feat(Examples): Add console output in Hello_World READMEs for all parts (#342) fix(Examples,PeriphDrivers): Deprecate MXC\\_RTC\\_GetSecond and MXC\\_RTC\\_GetSubSecond for all parts except for MAX32520 (#248) Please ensure all actions have passed or successfully completed before merging a PR into main . MSDK maintainers have permissions to merge approved PRs even with a failing action. PR Format Rules (Workflow Enforced) The type is case-sensitive and must be one of the listed types. The scope is case-sensitive and must be one of the listed scopes. The first word of the Subject must be capitalized. The Subject must not end with any punctuation (periods, commas, exclamation marks). Style Guide The MSDK code-base, for the most-part, follows the Linux Kernel coding style and Google's C++ Style Guide with the following exception(s): Indentations are 4 spaces. Formatting and styling is enforced via clang-format version 14 and cpplint , which automatically run checks against all PRs. A PR cannot be merged until it passes these checks. Running the Linter & Formatter Both utilities can be run locally. cpplint should be run first, then clang-format. Additionally, both should be run from the root directory of the MSDK repo so that their config files are loaded properly. clang-format rules are loaded from the .clang-format and cpplint rules are loaded from CPPLINT.cfg in the root directory of the repo. As a result, the utilities must also be run from the root directory of the repo. cpplint cpplint enforces good code practices by scanning for common mistakes and ensuring certain higher-level code patterns are followed. It's a good idea to resolve the errors found by cpplint before before running clang-format, which deals with lower-level code styling and syntax patterns. cd into the root directory of the MSDK repo. Run cpplint. To run cpplint on a file , use cpplint <filepath> . $ cpplint Examples/MAX78000/Hello_World/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/Hello_World/main.c To recursively run cpplint on an entire directory , use cpplint --recursive <filepath> . $ cpplint --recursive Examples/MAX78000 Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h:1: #ifndef header guard has wrong style, please use: EXAMPLES_MAX78000_ADC_EXAMPLE_CONFIG_H_ [build/header_guard] [5] Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h:14: #endif line should be \"#endif // EXAMPLES_MAX78000_ADC_EXAMPLE_CONFIG_H_\" [build/header_guard] [5] Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ADC/example_config.h Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ADC/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/AES/main.c Done processing Examples/MAX78000/ARM-DSP/arm_bayes_example/arm_bayes_example_f32.c ... Resolve any errors. git add and git commit any changes to your code. clang-format clang-format is a code formatter and style checker that enforces a common style for the code-base. The MSDK uses version 14 , which is sometimes not available by default on some Linux distributions. It can be retrieved from https://apt.llvm.org/ . cd into the root directory of the MSDK repo. Run clang-format. To run a clang-format check on a file, use the -n \"dry-run\" flag. clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -n <filename> For example: $ clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -n Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Formatting [1/1] Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c:86:40: error: code should be clang-formatted [-Wclang-format-violations] for (i = 0; i < DATA_LENGTH; i++) { array[i] = i; } ^ To apply the formatter to automatically format a file, use the -i flag. clang-format-14 --style=file --Werror --verbose -i <filename> For example: $ clang-format-14 --style=file --verbose -i Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c Formatting [1/1] Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c This will apply the formatter and overwrite the file. Check the formatter's work using git diff . $ diff --git a/Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c b/Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c index 1dda1feed..c16ceb962 100644 --- a/Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c +++ b/Examples/MAX78000/CRC/main.c @@ -83,7 +83,9 @@ void Test_CRC(int asynchronous) printf(asynchronous ? \"TEST CRC ASYNC\\n\" : \"TEST CRC SYNC\\n\"); - for (i = 0; i < DATA_LENGTH; i++) { array[i] = i; } + for (i = 0; i < DATA_LENGTH; i++) { + array[i] = i; + } To apply the formatter to multiple files, the * and ** wildcard characters can be used. * matches any file or folder, and ** recursively matches any file or folder.

It should be noted that ** is not supported on native Windows, but * is. git add and git commit any changes to your code. Now, it's ready for a PR! The same checks will be automatically run against any PRs that are opened in the MSDK, and they must pass before the code can be approved. Contributing Examples First, ensure that the example project has been linted and formatted to follow the Style Guide Copy the example project into the Examples folder of the SDK for the applicable target microcontrollers. git add and git commit the Example project. Commit your project files before running MSDKGen. Run the MSDKGen utility to ensure the example project's support files are updated to the latest version. python msdkgen.py update-all --projects yourprojectname --overwrite Re-test the project if applicable. If the updated files break any projects they can be restored to the previously working version using the git restore command. For example, the command below will restore all files in your current working directory. git restore ** The git diff command can also be used to inspect local changes to help identify the root cause. Ex: git diff ./ Contributing Libraries Libraries should be added to the Libraries sub-folder of the MSDK. All libraries should include a libraryname.mk file that can be added to Libraries/libs.mk via a toggle-switch. The filename should match the name of library as closely as possible, and expose any required configuration variables . If necessary, a library may also include a \"core\" Makefile or set of Makefiles to build it as a standalone static library file. The naming convention is lib<libraryname>.a . Self-Locating Makefile The first thing that the libraryname.mk file should do is locate its own directory and store it in a variable. The code snippet can be used to achieve this. ifeq \"$(LIBRARYNAME_DIR)\" \"\" # If LIBRARYNAME_DIR is not specified, this Makefile will locate itself. LIBRARYNAME_DIR := $(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)))) endif All filepaths for the library should then use this $(LIBRARYNAME_DIR) -type variable as their \"root\" for all filepaths. This is a safe and reliable way to self-reference internal library files. For an example, see the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/periphdriver.mk file. Simple Libraries For simple libraries, it may be sufficient to just add the library's source files to the build using VPATH and IPATH . For example: IPATH += $(LIBRARY_NAME_DIR)/include VPATH += $(LIBRARY_NAME_DIR)/src SRCS += libfile1.c SRCS += libfile2.c An example of this is MiscDrivers , which is a simple source-file-only library. It gets its source code selectively added to the build via Libraries/Boards/MAX78000/EvKit_V1/board.mk files. Advanced Libraries More advanced libraries (including those with a large number of source files) should include a rule to build as a static library file with a recursive Make call . This type of library should also set up the appropriate configuration variables to include that static library to the build. Contributing Documentation Code Maintainers MSDK code should be documented using Doxygen syntax on all public functions, data structures, and variables. See the DoxyGen Manual for more details on syntax for C-like languages. DoxyGen is automatically run across the MSDK code as part of the User Guide's build process. A Peripheral API reference is generated for each target microcontroller using the Doxygen files located in Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Documentation , and the output is packaged as a sub-component of the User Guide when it's built. For code maintainers no action is needed other than maintaining up to date Doxygen documentation for all source code. User Guide An MSDK User Guide is maintained in the USERUIDE.md file. This document contains higher-level usage info for the MSDK. If a part, IDE, or library is supported by the MSDK then there should be some relevant info in the User Guide covering its setup, configuration, and usage. When writing markdown links, relative paths should always be used. Additionally, links to local files on the user's filesystem cannot be used, since the online copy of the docs will throw a 404 on them. See Writing Your Docs for more details. Static resources such as images should be placed in the res folder. Building the Documentation Local Builds The Documentation/build.py script can be used to build the MSDK User Guide and supporting documentation locally. This script: Builds all the Peripheral API references using Doxygen and copies them into Documentation Copies any markdown (.md) files from the root of the repo into Documentation Builds the MSDK User Guide using Mkdocs , which packages everything in Documentation into a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript site in the docs folder. To build the docs: Install doxygen Add doxygen's binary diretory to the Environmental Path Variable Install Python 3 pip install -r Documentation/requirements.txt python Documentation/build.py The site will be built in the docs folder of the repo. To preview the generated site: mkdocs serve This will open a localhost test server with live re-loading. To configure the generated site, use mkdocs.yml . See Mkdocs Configuration for more details. Auto Builds and Deployment The \"Build & Deploy Docs\" Github Action will perform all the local steps above. Additionally, it will deploy the static site to the gh-pages branch of the repository for use with Github Pages . When the gh-pages branch is updated, Pages will refresh the online copy of the documentation within ~5-10 mins. This auto-deploy procedure is triggered on every push to the release branch.","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#analog-devices-msdk-development-and-contribution-guidelines","text":"","title":"Analog Devices MSDK Development and Contribution Guidelines"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING/#development-flow","text":"Development for the MSDK also follows the official GitHub development flow guidelines .

That includes register and system startup files to enable low-level development for its supported parts . It also provides higher-level peripheral driver APIs (written in C) alongside various utilities, third-party libraries, Board Support Packages (BSPs), and a set of example programs for each microcontroller. Additionally, the MSDK includes a GCC-based toolchain, and builds are managed by a system of Makefiles (See GNU Make ). A custom fork of OpenOCD enables flashing and debugging. The MSDK's toolchain and build system offers a Command Line Interface (CLI), and project files for supported development environments are maintained that build on top of that CLI. This document describes the MSDK's installation, setup, and usage. Supported Operating Systems Windows (Windows 10 only) Linux (Ubuntu only) MacOS Supported Parts The MSDK officially supports the following microcontrollers and evaluation platforms.

Continue to the installation page, and click install to begin. Installation can be safely canceled at any time. Click Finish to complete the installation. You should now see the contents of the installation directory populated with the MSDK. \u26a0\ufe0f Warning On MacOS, some additional steps are required. Command-Line Installation The MSDK installer features a command-line interface that can be used as an alternative to its GUI. This is useful for installations on \"headless\" systems and scripting. \u2139\ufe0f Note: \" The --help Command The available commands can be retrieved by running the MSDK installer executable with the --help option on the command line. For example: $ ./MaximMicrosSDK_linux.run --help Usage: ./MaximMicrosSDK_linux.run [options] command <args> <key=value> Qt Installer Framework supports both GUI and headless mode. The installation operations can be invoked with the following commands and options. Note that the options marked with \"CLI\" are available in the headless mode only. Commands: in, install - install default or selected packages - <pkg ...> ch, check-updates - show available updates information on maintenance tool up, update - update all or selected packages - <pkg ...> rm, remove - uninstall packages and their child components - <pkg ...> li, list - list currently installed packages - <regexp> se, search - search available packages - <regexp> Note: The --filter-packages option can be used to specify additional filters for the search operation co, create-offline - create offline installer from selected packages - <pkg ...> pr, purge - uninstall all packages and remove entire program directory Options: -h, --help Displays help on commandline options. # ... To run a headless installation: Download the installer executable to an accessible location. Ensure that you are able to run the installer with elevated permissions . Windows Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell as administrator . Ubuntu and MacOS Ensure you have sudo rights. Run the installer with the arguments in --root <install location> Windows .\\MaximMicrosSDK_win.exe in --root C:/MaximSDK Ubuntu and MacOS sudo ./MaximMicrosSDK_linux.run in --root ~/MaximSDK Follow the installer's command-line instructions to accept licenses and confirm installation size. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Unattended Installations You can run the installer without any user input by auto-accepting all licenses, messages, and input. sudo ./MaximMicrosSDK_linux.run in --root ~/MaximSDK --accept-licenses --accept-messages --confirm-command (Ubuntu and MacOS) Change ownership of the installation folder with: sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) <MSDK installation folder> \u2139\ufe0f Note: Folder Ownership Usually, running the installation with sudo results in an installation owned by the root user. You can verify this with the ls -la command. ls -la ~/MaximSDK total 29656 drwxr-xr-x 8 root root 4096 Jul 13 20:41 . drwxr-x--- 17 username username 4096 Jul 13 20:41 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 20:41 Documentation drwxr-xr-x 15 root root 4096 Jul 13 20:41 Examples -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 171189 Jul 13 20:41 InstallationLog.txt drwxr-xr-x 17 root root 4096 Jun 28 23:42 Libraries drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 13 20:41 Licenses -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 28287992 Jul 13 20:41 MaintenanceTool -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1719694 Jul 13 20:41 MaintenanceTool.dat -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 9770 Jul 13 20:41 MaintenanceTool.ini drwxr-xr-x 11 root root 4096 Jun 28 23:42 Tools -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 13123 Jun 28 23:48 changelog.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 67664 Jul 13 20:41 components.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 48 Jul 13 20:41 installer.dat drwxr-xr-x 112 root root 12288 Jul 13 20:41 installerResources -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 25214 Jun 29 00:47 maxim.ico -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 362 Jul 13 20:41 network.xml -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 1129 Jun 29 00:47 setenv.sh -rwxrwxrwx 1 root root 300 Jun 29 00:47 updates.sh The owner of the MSDK installation should be changed back to the normal user with the command above.

There are also some manual setup steps required to retrieve make version 4. The instructions in this section are critical. \u2139\ufe0f Instructions for M1 platforms The MSDK's OpenOCD binaries ship pre-compiled for Intel Silicon (i386). As a result, you should use a Rosetta terminal on M1 platforms to install the i386 version of Homebrew and retrieve OpenOCD's dependencies with it. Installing from Rosetta ensures OpenOCD gets the packages with the architecture it needs. From there, Rosetta will handle the rest and allow running the binaries on the M1 platform's arm64 architecture. Additionally, the MSDK toolchain requires Make 4.x+, which must also be retrieved via Homebrew. The i386 version of Homebrew can be installed in parallel with the arm64 version and typically installs into a separate filesystem. Open a terminal and update Rosetta. softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license Close the terminal. Create a new Rosetta terminal: Launch Finder. Navigate to Applications and find the \"Terminal\" application. Right-Click Terminal and Duplicate it. Rename it to \"Terminal i386\". This will be a new application shortcut to the Rosetta terminal. Right-Click \"Terminal i386\" > Get Info > Enable \"Open using Rosetta\" Launch the new \"Terminal i386\" and type arch to verify that it says i386 now. From your Rosetta terminal, follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system. Verify the correct version of Homebrew is running from your Rosetta terminal using the which brew command. This command should return a path beginning with /usr/local . Note: On systems with multiple or pre-existing Homebrew installations, the arm64 version of Homebrew may still take precedence over the newly installed x86_64 version. If which brew contains /opt/homebrew instead, you may need to edit your terminal profile's startup script. Alternatively, you can directly run the correct Homebrew binary using its absolute path. Run the command brew install make libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb (or, if you need to use the absolute path) /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew make install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb The MSDK toolchain is dependent on GNU make 4.x+ being available as make , but Homebrew will install it as gmake . Modify your shell's startup script ( ~/.zshrc ) to account for this. Run brew info make for more details, and check the \"caveats\" section. ==> make: stable 4.4.1 (bottled) Utility for directing compilation https://www.gnu.org/software/make/ /usr/local/Cellar/make/4.4.1 (16 files, 1.3MB) * Poured from bottle using the formulae.brew.sh API on 2023-03-28 at 17:46:43 From: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/HEAD/Formula/make.rb License: GPL-3.0-only ==> Dependencies Build: lzip, lzip ==> Caveats GNU \"make\" has been installed as \"gmake\".

Open the ~/.zshrc in a text editor and follow the instructions that Homebrew listed in the \"Caveats\" section. For example, given the Homebrew output above one would add the following contents to ~/.zshrc . The exact path may vary across different systems and Homebrew versions. PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/make/libexec/gnubin:$PATH\" Restart your shell and verify that make --version returns 4.x+. \u2139\ufe0f Instructions for non-M1 platforms Follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system.

Maintenance An MSDK installation contains a MaintenanceTool executable program in its root directory. Use the Maintenance Tool to retrieve updates, manage components, and uninstall the MSDK. Updates The MSDK releases updates quarterly, and the Maintenance Tool will retrieve the latest release when Update components is run. Older Versions and Offline Installer Older versions of the MSDK are available as an offline installer for each release tag. They are available on the Releases page of the MSDK GitHub and can be used to roll back to a specific MSDK release. Development Resources Users can obtain development copies of the MSDK resources from Github . Setup instructions can be found in the repository's README . Getting Started The MSDK is designed for both evaluation and end-application development. The typical evaluation cycle usually involves setting up the development environment, running demos, and exercising the peripheral driver API on an evaluation platform . The typical development cycle typically involves building a prototype application on an evaluation platform first, then porting the application to a custom board. This section describes how to get started with the MSDK focusing on the evaluation cycle. First , review the Key Concepts below. Then, proceed to the section for your preferred IDE. Each sub-section is written as a self-contained quick-start with links to additional documentation on important topics. Getting Started with Visual Studio Code Getting Started with Eclipse Getting Started with Command-Line Development Key Concepts The MSDK supports multiple development environments with different features that may tailor to the user's preferences. There are a few key concepts to remember that are universal to MSDK development. Target Microcontroller : The target microcontroller refers to the base part number of the microcontroller used for development. The MSDK contains register-level support and startup files for each of its supported parts , and it's important to note that support files for a target microcontroller and its Board Support Packages are distinct from each other. For example, if the MAX78000EVKIT or MAX78000FTHR is being used, the Target Microcontroller is the MAX78000. Board Support Package (BSP) : The MSDK supports evaluation platforms for target microcontrollers with Board Support Packages . For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs are available. These can be found in the Libraries/Boards folder of the MSDK installation. By default, most projects in the MSDK come pre-configured for the \"EVKIT\"-type BSP, which is generally the largest evaluation platform for that device with most (or all) pins broken out. It's important to note that the active BSP may need to be reconfigured for a project, which is done slightly differently for each development environment. System Environment : Your system's environment is a broad term that encapsulates the programs and variables available to your system's shell on the command line. The user is expected to have some basic familiarity with this concept. System Path : Your system's Path is a unique environment variable that tells it where to search for program binaries. The user is expected to be familiar with this concept and how to modify the system Path if necessary. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) : An IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) that manages the tools for editing source code, building source code, flashing program binaries, and debugging . The abbreviation is frequently used in this document, and the MSDK supports multiple IDEs that can be used depending on preference. (See \"Supported Development Environments\" ) Build Configuration vs. Project Configuration : An MSDK project is comprised of two complementary systems: The Build System and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) . These systems each offer their own configuration interfaces, and it's important to note what each is used for. The Build System manages source code compilation into program binaries and offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for setting Build Configuration Variables . The IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) for managing a project and sits on top of the build system's CLI . Each IDE offers its own settings for managing fundamental aspects of the build, such as: Setting the Target Microcontroller Setting the Board Support Package Configuring the Environment and System Path for use with the MSDK toolchain Getting Started with Visual Studio Code The MSDK includes Visual Studio Code (\"VS Code\") support through the VSCode-Maxim project. This section walks through setup, opening, and running an example project with VS Code. This material is also available in video form targeting the MAX78000 in \"Understanding Artificial Intelligence Episode 8.5 - Visual Studio Code\" . For complete documentation, see the Visual Studio Code section of this User Guide. Setup (VS Code) The setup below only needs to be done once per MSDK installation . Download and install Visual Studio Code for your OS here . Launch Visual Studio Code. Install the Microsoft C/C++ extension . Install the Cortex-Debug extension Use CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS) to open the developer prompt. Type \"open user settings\" and select the \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\" option. Add the entries below to your user settings.json file. // There may be other settings up here... \"MAXIM_PATH\": \"Change me! Only use forward slashes (/) for this path\", \"update.mode\": \"manual\", \"extensions.autoUpdate\": false, // There may be other settings down here... \u26a0\ufe0f Setting MAXIM_PATH Set the MAXIM_PATH option to the absolute path of the MSDK installation. For example, you might set \"MAXIM_PATH\":\"C:/MaximSDK\" on Windows and \"MAXIM_PATH\":\"/home/username/MaximSDK\" on Ubuntu/MacOS. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Automatic Updates \"update.mode: \"manual\" and \"extensions.autoUpdate\": false disable automatic updates of VS Code and its extensions, respectively. This is an optional (but recommended) addition left over from the early days of VS Code development when there was lots of feature churn. Things have stabilized more as of version 1.70+, but updates remain frequent. For the VSCode-Maxim project files, the exact version numbers tested with each release can be found on the VSCode-Maxim Releases page. Save your changes to the file with CTRL + S and restart VS Code. Building and Running a Project (VS Code) Launch Visual Studio Code. Select File -> Open Folder... Navigate to an example project for the target microcontroller in the MSDK's Examples folder. \u26a0\ufe0f Copying Examples It's strongly recommended to copy example projects to an outside folder before modifying them. This keeps the MSDK's \"source\" copy preserved for reference. Project folders must be copied to a location without any spaces in its filepath. VS Code will prompt for trust the first time. Select Trust folder and enable all features The opened project should look something like this. Set the Board Support Package to match your evaluation platform. In VS Code, this is done by editing the .vscode/settings.json file and setting the \"board\" project configuration option. \u2139\ufe0f Note See Board Support Packages for more details and a table of values. Save your changes to settings.json with CTRL+S . Reload the VS Code window. After changing any options in settings.json , a reload is necessary to force it to re-index VS Code's Intellisense engine. VS Code can be conveniently reloaded with the Reload Window developer command accessed with CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS). Press the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B to open the available Build Tasks (alternatively navigate to Terminal -> Run Build task... ). Run the \"build\" task to compile the project for the configured Target Microcontroller and BSP . Notice that the TARGET and BOARD Build Configuration Variables are set on the command line. The program binary is successfully compiled into the .elf program binary in the build sub-folder of the project. Connect a debug adapter between the host PC and the evaluation platform. Detailed instructions on this hardware setup can be found in the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Run the flash build task. Running this task will automatically build the project if needed, flash the program binary, and halt the program execution to await a debugger connection. Open the Run and Debug window ( CTRL+SHIFT+D ) and launch the debugger ( F5 ). Verify the program counter enters main successfully. Press Continue ( F5 ) to run the program. Continue | Step Over | Step Into | Step Out | Restart | Stop Exercise the debugger and press stop to disconnect when finished. \u2139\ufe0f Note See Visual Studio Code for additional more detailed documentation. Getting Started with Eclipse Setup (Eclipse) The only setup required to use Eclipse is to ensure that the \"Eclipse\" component has been selected during the MSDK installation . If the MSDK is already installed, Eclipse can be retrieved using the Maintenance Tool . This section is an Eclipse \"quick-start\" that walks through creating, building, and running a project. For complete documentation, see the Eclipse section of this User Guide. Building and Running a Project (Eclipse) Launch Eclipse with its start menu shortcut. Ensure Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective in the top right corner. Otherwise, the new project wizard will not show up. Navigate to File -> New -> Maxim Microcontrollers . Enter the project name and hit Next . Follow the new project wizard. Chip type selects the Target Microcontroller Board type selects the Board Support Package (BSP) Example type selects the example project to be copied as the template for the new project. Adapter type selects the debug adapter to use. Select Finish to create the new project. Build the project using the Build hammer button (top left). Select the correct project in the Launch Configuration dropdown and set it to Debug mode. Use the Debug button (top left) to flash the program binary and connect the debugger. The Eclipse view will switch to debug mode, and the debugger will break on entry into main . Resume the program ( F8 ) using the top control bar and exercise the debugger. Terminate the debugger ( CTRL+F2 ) when finished. \u2139\ufe0f Note See Eclipse for additional more detailed documentation. Getting Started with Command-Line Development This section demonstrates how to build MSDK example projects on the command line. It also shows how to flash and debug over the command line. The MAX78002EVKIT will be used as an example, but the same concepts apply to all parts. For more detailed documentation, see the Command-Line Development section of this User Guide. Setup (Command-Line) Windows On Windows, use the MinGW shortcut to launch an MSYS2/MinGW terminal. This shortcut points to Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat in an MSDK installation and correctly configures the user's environment for development. Linux/MacOS Sourcing setenv A setenv.sh script is available in the root directory of an MSDK installation. This file can be sourced to facilitate the setup of an environment for MSDK development. source ~/MaximSDK/setenv.sh This command can also be added to shell startup scripts ( ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc , etc.) to automate the environment setup. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Automatic Updates setenv.sh will automatically check for available updates to the MSDK. This can be permanently disabled by following its prompt on startup, or by deleting/moving the updates.sh script in the root directory of the MSDK installation. Manual Setup On Linux and MacOS, copy the following contents into your shell's terminal profile/startup script to manually configure your environment for MSDK development. Depending on your system and shell, this could be ~/.profile , ~/.zprofile , ~/.bashrc , ~/.zshrc , etc. Command-line Linux/MacOS users are expected to know which file to edit for their particular system and preferences. # Set MAXIM_PATH to point to the MSDK export MAXIM_PATH=#changeme! # Add Arm Embedded GCC to path (v10.3) export ARM_GCC_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/GNUTools/10.3 export PATH=$ARM_GCC_ROOT/bin:$PATH # Add xPack RISC-V GCC to path (v12.2) export XPACK_GCC_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/xPack/riscv-none-elf-gcc/12.2.0-3.1 export PATH=$XPACK_GCC_ROOT/bin:$PATH # Add OpenOCD to path export OPENOCD_ROOT=$MAXIM_PATH/Tools/OpenOCD export PATH=$OPENOCD_ROOT:$PATH Change export MAXIM_PATH=#changeme! to the installation location of the MSDK. This will make the toolchain accessible from the command line by adding it to your system's path . # Set MAXIM_PATH environment variable export MAXIM_PATH=$HOME/MaximSDK Verification Run the following commands to verify that the toolchain is accessible. They should display version numbers successfully. arm-none-eabi-gcc -v arm-none-eabi-gdb -v make -v openocd -v Any \"file not found\" errors indicate that MAXIM_PATH has not been set correctly or the system's Path has not been configured correctly. Building and Running an Example (Command-Line) First, copy an example project to an accessible directory outside of the SDK. The Hello_World project is a good one to start with. \u26a0\ufe0f Copying Examples It's strongly recommended to copy example projects to an outside folder before modifying them. This keeps the MSDK's \"source\" copy preserved for reference. Project folders must be copied to a location without any spaces in its filepath. Launch your terminal. On Windows, use the MinGW shortcut or Tools/MSYS2/msys.bat file to launch the MSYS2 terminal. cd into the location of the copied example project. Run the following command to build the example: make \u2139\ufe0f Note: Improving Build Speed The following command can be used to enable parallel builds and drastically improve build speed: make -r -j --output-sync=target --no-print-directory -r is an option that ignores some of Make's implicit rules to improve build speed. -j enables parallel execution of the build in the maximum number of threads. \u26a0\ufe0f Parallel Builds Parallel builds can mangle the console output. To deal with this, the --output-sync=target option can be used. However, this is only available in Make version 4 or higher . When this option is used, --no-print-directory is also used to declutter the build output.

Detailed instructions on this hardware setup can be found in the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Flash and run the program with OpenOCD. make flash.openocd \u2139\ufe0f Note: Flashing with Make The command make flash.openocd is a build target added to the MSDK as of the June 2023 Release to make flashing over the command-line easier. It launches and drives an OpenOCD server behind the scenes to flash the project's binary. See the Tools/Flash/flash.mk file for implementation details, and Flashing on the Command-Line for more details on launching debug server/clients manually.

Visual Studio Code Support for Visual Studio Code is maintained for the MSDK and developed on the VSCode-Maxim GitHub repository. For setup/quick-start instructions, see \"Getting Started with Visual Studio Code\" first. This section offers detailed usage info focusing on the typical development cycle. Opening Example Projects Visual Studio Code is built around a \"working directory\" paradigm. The editor is always rooted in a working directory, and the main mechanism for changing that directory is File -> Open Folder... As a result, you'll notice that there is no \"New Project\" mechanism. A \"project\" in VS Code is simply a folder. It will look inside the opened folder for a .vscode sub -folder to load project-specific settings from. (Note: You may need to enable viewing of hidden items in your file explorer to see the .vscode sub-folder). To open a project: Launch Visual Studio Code. Select File -> Open Folder... Navigate to an example project for the target microcontroller in the MSDK's Examples folder. \u26a0\ufe0f Copying Examples It's strongly recommended to copy example projects to an outside folder before modifying them. This keeps the MSDK's \"source\" copy preserved for reference. Project folders must be copied to a location without any spaces in its filepath. VS Code will prompt for trust the first time. Select Trust folder and enable all features The opened project should look something like this. Verify the Board Support Package for the project is set correctly. How to Set the BSP (VS Code) To set the BSP for an open project: Set the \"board\" project configuration option in .vscode/settings.json , which maps to the BOARD Build Configuration Variable . See Board Support Packages for a table of possible values. Reload the VS Code window to re-index its Intellisense engine. VS Code can be conveniently reloaded with the Reload Window developer command accessed with CTRL + SHIFT + P (or COMMAND + SHIFT + P on MacOS). Build Tasks Once a project is opened 4 available build tasks will become available via Terminal > Run Build task... or the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+B . These tasks are configured by the .vscode/task.json file. Build Compiles the code with a make all command. Additional options are passed into Make on the command-line based on the project's settings.json file. The ./build directory will be created and will contain the output binary, as well as all intermediary object files. Notice the TARGET , BOARD , and PROJECT Build Configuration Variables being set on the command line, and the program binary successfully compiled into the .elf program binary in the build sub-folder of the project. Clean Cleans the build output, removing the ./build directory and all of its contents. Clean-Periph This task is the same as 'clean', but it also removes the build output for the MSDK's peripheral drivers. Use this if you would like to recompile the peripheral drivers from source on the next build. Flash Launching this task automatically runs the Build task first. Then, it flashes the output binary to the microcontroller. It uses the GDB load and compare-sections commands, and handles launching an OpenOCD internally via a pipe connection. The flashed program will be halted until the microcontroller is reset, power cycled, or a debugger is connected. A debugger must be connected correctly to use this task. Refer to the datasheet of your microcontroller's evaluation board for instructions. Flash & Run This is the same as the Flash task, but it also will launch execution of the program once flashing is complete. Erase Flash Completely erases all of the application code in the flash memory bank. Once complete, the target microcontroller will be effectively \"blank\". This can be useful for recovering from Low-Power (LP) lockouts, bad firmware, etc. Flashing and Debugging This section assumes a debugger is connected between the host PC and the evaluation platform. For more detailed instructions on this hardware setup, refer to the evaluation platform's Datasheet and Quick-Start Guide, which are available on its analog.com product page. Arm Core Debugging Run the flash build task . Running this task will automatically build the project if needed, flash the program binary, and halt the program execution to await a debugger connection. Flashing does not happen automatically when launching the debugger . This is an intentional design choice for VS Code to allow the debugger to quickly restart the program under debug without a lengthy re-flash procedure. Open the Run and Debug window ( CTRL+SHIFT+D ) and select the Debug Arm (Cortex-debug) profile. Verify the program counter enters main successfully. Press Continue ( F5 ) to run the program. The debugger control bar can be used to exercise the debugger further. Continue | Step Over | Step Into | Step Out | Restart | Stop Breakpoints Breakpoints can be set by clicking next to a line number in VS Code's editor. They are removed by clicking on them again. Additionally conditional breakpoints can be added by right-clicking on a line. The condition and condition type can be modified with the dropdown. This is useful for setting a breakpoint on a certain value in a for loop iterator or when a specific bit in a register is set, for example. Peripheral Browsing A peripheral browser lets you quickly view the formatted register-level contents of the peripheral blocks on a target microcontroller under debug. As of the v1.6.0 VSCode-Maxim project files, pre-made Cortex-Debug launch profiles are included in each project. These profiles enable peripheral browsing via an embedded \"Cortex Peripherals\"window. Alternatively, watch expressions can be used. These can be set for registers and variables. (For example, the sysctrl register below). Adding ,b lets you print out the value in binary Adding ,x prints the value in hex . Standard logical and bitwise operations are supported inside the watch expression. Register and variable values can be modified through these same watch-points. (Right click -> Set Value) It should be noted that the debugger's watch points are contextual , meaning that its symbol look-ups will depend on the active point in your program. Disassembly View Stepping through disassembly is supported and enabled by the Cortex-Debug launch profile. To open the disassembly view: Launch a debug session with the Debug Arm (Cortex-Debug) profile. Open the developer command prompt with CTRL + SHIFT + P . Run the \"Open Disassembly View\" developer command. Alternatively, right click -> \"Open Disassembly View\" The debugger will step through whichever window has the active focus. Set the focus to the disassembly window to step through the assembly code. See the Cortex-Debug Wiki for more details. Dual Core Debugging For microcontrollers with both an Arm M4 and a RISC-V core, the GDB (RISC-V) launch profile is provided to enable RISC-V debugging. \u2139\ufe0f Note The RISC-V core requires setup and handoff from the Arm M4 core. As a result, this is an advanced configuration requiring a unique combination of the project's source code, Makefiles, and VSCode-Maxim project settings. Such projects are appended with the -riscv suffix in the project's folder name. This section demonstrates how to debug -riscv projects in VS Code using the mnist-riscv project for the MAX78000 as an example. Connect both your Arm (SWD) and RISC-V (JTAG) debuggers. VSCode-Maxim projects come pre-configured to use the ARM-USB-OCD-H + ARM-JTAG-20-10 adapters for the RISC-V JTAG port. Ex: \u26a0\ufe0f Olimex Drivers If connection issues occur with the Olimex adapter, verify that the drivers are installed correctly. See Section 3.3.3 of the Olimex User Manual . The Zadig tool to install WinUSB drivers. Open the project in VS Code. Run the \"Flash\" task. Launch the debugger using the Debug Arm (Cortex-Debug) or GDB (Arm M4) profile first : ... which should hit the breakpoint in main.c ... Continue the debugger. The code in main.c will boot up the RISC-V core. You can optionally set a breakpoint on WakeISR to see when the RISC-V core has signaled it's ready. Now, switch the debugger profile to the GDB (RISC-V) profile and launch it. This will launch an additional instance on a separate port and connect to the Olimex adapter. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Signal 0 Exception The \"Signal 0\" exception below is a known issue caused by a signaling mismatch between the RISC-V core and VS Code's debugger engine. The exception message is harmless and can be safely ignored. From here, the debugger should be fully functional. The Arm vs. RISC-V debugger instance can be selected with the dropdown on the debugger control bar. Project Settings .vscode/settings.json is the main project configuration file. Values set here are parsed into the other .json config files. When a change is made to this file, VS Code should be reloaded with CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Reload Window (or alternatively restarted completely) to force a re-parse. The default project configuration should work for most use cases as long as \"target\" and \"board\" are set correctly. \u2139\ufe0f Note Any field from settings.json can be referenced from any other VS Code config file (including itself) with \"${config:[fieldname]}\" The following configuration options are available: \"MAXIM_PATH\" This option must point to the root installation directory of the MSDK. It should be placed in the global user settings.json file during first-time VSCode-Maxim setup. See Getting Started with Visual Studio Code . \"target\" This sets the target microcontroller for the project. It sets the TARGET Build Configuration variable. \"board\" This sets the target board for the project (ie. Evaluation Kit, Feather board, etc.) See How to Set the BSP (VS Code) \"terminal.integrated.env.[platform]:Path\" This prepends the location of the MSDK toolchain binaries to the system Path used by VSCode's integrated terminal. The Path is not sanitized by default, which means that the terminal inherits the system path. \"project_name\" Sets the name of project. This is used in other config options such as program_file . Default value: \"${workspaceFolderBasename}\" \"program_file\" Sets the name of the file to flash and debug. This is provided in case it's needed, but for most use cases should be left at its default. File extension must be included. Default value: \"${config:project_name}.elf\" \"symbol_file\" Sets the name of the file that GDB will load debug symbols from. File extension must be included. Default value: \"${config:program_file}\" \"M4_OCD_interface_file\" Sets the OpenOCD interface file to use to connect to the Arm M4 core. This should match the debugger being used for the M4 core. The MaximSDK/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/interface folder is searched for the file specified by this setting. .cfg file extension must be included. Default value: \"cmsis-dap.cfg\" \"M4_OCD_target_file\" Sets the OpenOCD target file to use for the Arm M4 core. This should match the target microcontroller. .cfg file extension must be included. The MaximSDK/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/target folder is searched for the file specified by this setting. Default value: \"${config:target}.cfg\" \"RV_OCD_interface_file\" Sets the OpenOCD interface file to use to connect to the RISC-V core. This should match the debugger being used for the RISC-V core. The MaximSDK/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/interface folder is searched for the file specified by this setting. .cfg file extension must be included. Default value: \"ftdi/olimex-arm-usb-ocd-h.cfg\" \"RV_OCD_target_file\" Sets the OpenOCD target file to use for the RISC-V core. The MaximSDK/Tools/OpenOCD/scripts/target folder is searched for the file specified by this setting. .cfg file extension must be included. Default value: \"${config:target}_riscv.cfg\" \"v_Arm_GCC\" Sets the version of the Arm Embedded GCC to use, including toolchain binaries and the standard library version. This gets parsed into ARM_GCC_path . Default value: \"10.3\" \"v_xPack_GCC\" Sets the version of the xPack RISC-V GCC to use. This gets parsed into xPack_GCC_path . Default value: \"12.2.0-3.1\" \"OCD_path\" Where to find the OpenOCD. Default value: \"${config:MAXIM_PATH}/Tools/OpenOCD\" \"ARM_GCC_path\" Where to find the Arm Embedded GCC Toolchain. Default value: \"${config:MAXIM_PATH}/Tools/GNUTools/${config:v_Arm_GCC}\" \"xPack_GCC_path\" Where to find the RISC-V GCC Toolchain. Default value: \"${config:MAXIM_PATH}/Tools/xPack/riscv-none-elf-gcc/${config:v_xPack_GCC}\" \"Make_path\" Where to find Make binaries (only used on Windows) Default value: \"${config:MAXIM_PATH}/Tools/MSYS2/usr/bin\" \"C_Cpp.default.includePath\" Which paths to search to find header (.h) files. Does not recursively search by default. To recursively search, use /** . \"C_Cpp.default.browse.path\" Which paths to search to find source (.c) files. Does not recursively search by default. To recursively search, use /** . \"C_Cpp.default.defines\" Sets the compiler definitions to use for the intellisense engine. Most definitions should be defined in header files, but if a definition is missing it can be entered here to get the intellisense engine to recognize it. Setting Search Paths for Intellisense VS Code's intellisense engine must be told where to find the header files for your source code. By default, the MSDK's peripheral drivers, the C standard libraries, and all of the sub-directories of the workspace will be searched for header files to use with Intellisense. If VS Code throws an error on an #include statement (and the file exists), then a search path is most likely missing. To add additional search paths : Open the .vscode/settings.json file. Add the include path(s) to the C_Cpp.default.includePath list. The paths set here should contain header files, and will be searched by the Intellisense engine and when using \"Go to Declaration\" in the editor. Add the path(s) to any relevant implementation files to the C_Cpp.default.browse.path list. This list contains the paths that will be searched when using \"Go to Definition\". Project Creation Option 1. Copying a Pre-Made Project Copying a pre-made example project is a great way to get rolling quickly, and is currently the recommended method for creating new projects. The release package for this project (Located at Tools/VSCode-Maxim in the MSDK) contains a New_Project folder designed for such purposes. Additionally, any of the VS Code-enabled Example projects can be copied from the MSDK. Copy the existing project folder to an accessible location. This will be the location of your new project. \u26a0\ufe0f Warning The full path to the project must not have any spaces in it. (Optional) Rename the folder. For example, I might rename the folder to MyProject . Open the project in VS Code ( File -> Open Folder... ) Set your target microcontroller and board correctly. CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Reload Window to re-parse the project settings. That's it! The existing project is ready to build, debug, and modify. Option 2 - Injecting VSCode-Maxim releases provide the Inject folder for \"injecting\" into an existing folder. If you want to start from scratch or use the project files with existing source code, take this option. Create your project folder if necessary. For example, I might create a new project in a workspace folder with the path: C:/Users/Jake.Carter/workspace/MyNewProject . Copy the contents of the Inject folder into the project folder from step 1. The contents to copy include a .vscode folder, a Makefile , and a project.mk file. For this example, the contents of the 'MyProject' folder would be the following: C:/Users/Jake.Carter/workspace/MyNewProject |- .vscode |- Makefile |- project.mk Open the project in VS Code ( File -> Open Folder... ) Set your target microcontroller and board correctly. CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Reload Window to re-parse the project settings. Configure the build system for use with any pre-existing source code. That's it! Your new project can now be opened with File > Open Folder from within VS Code. Eclipse For setup/quick-start instructions, see \"Getting Started with Eclipse\" first. This section offers detailed usage info focusing on the typical development cycle. Running Eclipse Eclipse must be launched with the Eclipse MaximSDK shortcut. The shortcut points to the Tools/Eclipse/cdt/eclipse(.bat/.sh) file, which configures Eclipse's system environment for use with the MSDK toolchain. When Eclipse is launched, it will prompt for a workspace location. This is a local folder that Eclipse will copy its projects into. Creating a New Project Launch Eclipse. Ensure that the Eclipse is set to the C/C++ perspective in the top right corner. Otherwise, the new project wizard will not show up. Navigate to File -> New -> Maxim Microcontrollers . Enter the project name and hit Next . Follow the new project wizard. Chip type selects the Target Microcontroller Board type selects the Board Support Package (BSP) Example type selects the example project to be copied as the template for the new project. Adapter type selects the debug adapter to use. Select Finish to create the new project. Importing Examples Launch Eclipse. Use File -> Import to open the import wizard. Select General -> Existing Projects into Workspace and hit Next . Browse to the Examples folder in the MSDK installation for your target microcontroller and select the example projects to import into the workspace.

All IDEs interface with this system. The Build System is managed by two files found in a project's root directory, one called Makefile and one called project.mk . These files are used by the GNU Make program (which is a part of the MSDK toolchain) to locate and build a project's source code. Makefile is the \"core\" file and should not be edited directly. Instead, it exposes the CLI that can be accessed in the project.mk file, on the command line, in your system's environment, or through your IDE. It also comes with a default configuration that is suitable for most projects. project.mk offers a convenient and stable access point for advanced build configuration, and this is the file that should be edited if necessary. When the command make is run from inside of a project folder, the program make will resolve any project-specific settings and then build the project's source code. Default Build Behavior By default, the build system will auto-search the root project directory for source code ( *.c ) and header files ( *.h ) to compile into a program binary. The optional include and src directories are also searched if they exist. Root Project Directory \u251c\u2500 project.mk \u251c\u2500 Makefile \u251c\u2500 *.h \u251c\u2500 *.c \u251c\u2500include # <-- Optional \u2514\u2500 *.h \u251c\u2500src # <-- Optional \u2514\u2500 *.c Additionally, a project's build system will come pre-configured for a specific Target Microcontroller and its primary BSP . The default configuration is suitable for most use cases, but a system of Build Configuration Variables is available if additional configuration is needed. Build Configuration Variables A Build Configuration Variable is a Makefile variable and therefore follows the same rules. However, they have been streamlined to be made much easier to use, so most of the official GNU Make documentation is only needed for advanced use cases. How to Set a Build Configuration Variable To set a standard configuration variable, use the = syntax ... VARIABLE=VALUE The = operator is used for most configuration variables with a few exceptions (documented in the reference table ) when a variable should contain a list of values . In such cases, use += the syntax to add values to the list. VARIABLE+=VALUE1 VARIABLE+=VALUE2 Where to Set a Build Configuration Variable For most variables, you should set them in the project.mk file (exceptions are documented in the reference table and IDE-specific sections). For example, to enable hardware floating-point acceleration for a project, the MFLOAT_ABI configuration variable can be used with a value of hard . The contents of project.mk might then look as follows: ( Inside project.mk ) # This file can be used to set build configuration # variables. These variables are defined in a file called # \"Makefile\" that is located next to this one. # For instructions on how to use this system, see # https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/msdk/USERGUIDE/ # ********************************************************** MFLOAT_ABI=hard # Enable hardware floating point acceleration It should also be noted that configuration variables can be set on the command line as well. For example make MFLOAT_ABI=hard will have the same effect. Additionally, environment variables can be used. For example (on Linux) export MFLOAT_ABI=hard will set the hardware floating point acceleration as the default for all projects with an environment variable. However, there is a precedence hierarchy that should be taken into consideration. Precedence Hierarchy The precedence hierarchy for the value of a configuration variable is: IDE/command-line > project.mk > environment variable > default value If a value is set in an IDE and project.mk, the IDE's value will take precedence. However, the \"override\" directive can be used in project.mk to give it max precedence. Build Tables The following sections present the available Build Configuration Variables . Primary Build Variables Configuration Variable Description Details MAXIM_PATH (Optional) Specify the location of the MSDK This optional variable can be used to change where the Makefile looks for the MSDK installation. By default, the build system will attempt to locate the MSDK with a relative path. If a project is moved outside of the SDK, this variable must be set to the absolute path of the MSDK installation. TARGET Set the Target Microcontroller If you are using an IDE, set this variable in the IDE's settings instead of project.mk BOARD Set the Board Support Package (BSP) If you are using an IDE, set this variable in the IDE's settings instead of project.mk. See Board Support Packages for more details. When you change this option, it's usually a good idea to fully clean your project, then rebuild. BSP_SEARCH_DIR Set the directory to search for the Board Support Package (BSP) By default, the Libraries/Boards folder of the MSDK is searched for the TARGET microcontroller. This setting is useful for loading custom BSPs from outside of the MSDK. When LIB_BOARD=1 , the build system looks for the file path at $(BSP_SEARCH_DIR)/$(BOARD)/board.mk . See BSP Search Directory for more details. Project Build Variables The following variables deal with fundamental project tasks such as adding source code, include paths, changing the output filename, etc. Configuration Variable Description Details VPATH Where to search for source (.c/.cpp) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for source code files. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled (which it is by default), all source code files in the directories specified by this option will be automatically added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, this tells the Makefile where to look for the files specified by SRCS . IPATH Where to search for header (.h) files Use the += operator with this variable . This controls where the Makefile will look for header files. Unlike the VPATH option, this is not related to AUTOSEARCH . Individual header files are not ever manually added to the build. Instead, you only need to specify the location of your header files. SRCS List of source (.c/.cpp) files to add to the build Use the += operator with this variable . All of the files in this list will be added to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is enabled, this is most useful for adding the full absolute path to a singular source file to selectively add to the build. If AUTOSEARCH is disabled, all of the source files for the project must be added to SRCS , and they must also all be located on an entry in VPATH . Otherwise, a full path relative to the Makefile must be used. AUTOSEARCH Automatically search for source (.c/.cpp) files Enable or disable the automatic detection of .c files on VPATH (enabled by default). Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. If auto-search is disabled, source files must be manually added to SRCS . PROJECT Set the output filename This controls the output filename of the build. File extensions should not be included in the filename. For VS Code, you should use the project_name advanced config option instead of project.mk. PROJ_LIBS Add a static library file (.a) to the project Use the += operator with this variable . Additional static libraries to link against can be added with this option. It should be noted that static library files are named with the lib<libraryname>.a convention. Only add <libraryname> to this variable. Ex: Give a file called libEXAMPLE.a , write PROJ_LIBS += EXAMPLE Additionally, ensure that the location of the library is added to PROJ_LDFLAGS . Ex: PROJ_LDFLAGS += -Lsome/library/search/directory Build Variables for the Compiler The following variables can be used to interface with the compiler to perform common tasks such as changing the optimization level, adding compiler definitions to the build, and changing floating point acceleration. Configuration Variable Description Details MXC_OPTIMIZE_CFLAGS Set the optimization level See Optimize Options for more details. Normal builds will default to -Og , which is good for debugging, while release builds will default to -O2 . PROJ_CFLAGS Add compiler flags to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Compiler flags can be added with this option, including compiler definitions. For each value, the same syntax should be used as if the compiler flag was passed in over the command line. These can include standard GCC options and/or ARM-specific options. PROJ_AFLAGS Add assemblers flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Assembler flags can be added with this option. PROJ_OBJS Add object files to the build Use the += operator with this variable . If needed, object files (.o) can be added to the build with this option. DEBUG Toggle extra debug information Set this to 1 to enable extra debug information at compile time. This generally improves the reliability of debugging at some increase in code size. Set to 0 to disable. Build Variables for the Linker Configuration Variable Description Details LINKERFILE Set the linkerfile to use A linkerfile is responsible for specifying the available memory banks, their layout, and the organization of program binaries memory. The file should exist in Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/TARGET/Source/GCC in the MSDK, or it should be placed inside the root directory of the project. PROJ_LDFLAGS Add a linker flag to the build Use the += operator with this variable . Flags can be passed to the linker with this option. See GCC Options for Linking Build Variables for Arm Cortex-M4 Cores The following build variables are used to control options specific to the Arm Cortex-M4 core available. They are available on all microcontrollers, and for all projects unless that project is built for a RISC-V core. Configuration Variable Description Details MFLOAT_ABI Set the floating point acceleration level Sets the floating-point acceleration level. Permitted values are hard , soft , and softfp (default). To enable full hardware acceleration instructions, use hard , but keep in mind that all libraries your source code uses must also be compiled with hard . If there is any conflict, you'll get a linker error. For more details, see -mfloat-abi under ARM Options . DEFAULT_OPTIMIZE_FLAGS Override the default extra optimization flags Extra compiler optimization flags are added to the build. They are defined in Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/GCC/gcc.mk . These can be disabled entirely by setting this variable to empty ( DEFAULT_OPTIMIZE_FLAGS= ). DEFAULT_WARNING_FLAGS Override the default warning flags Default flags controlling warning output are added in Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/GCC/gcc.mk . These can be disabled entirely by setting this variable to empty ( DEFAULT_OPTIMIZE_FLAGS= ). Build Variables for RISC-V Cores The following build variables are used for RISC-V development. They are only available on microcontrollers with RISC-V cores. Configuration Variable Description Details RISCV_CORE Build a project for the RISC-V core Set to 1 to convert an entire project to use the RISC-V toolchain. Only available on microcontrollers with a RISC-V core. RISCV_LOAD Compile and load project for the RISC-V core Only available on the MAX32655, MAX32680, and MAX32690 . Set to 1 compile the project specified by RISCV_APP for the RISC-V core and link it into the same binary as the current project. Useful for dual-core projects. RISCV_APP Project folder to compile for the RISCV_LOAD option Only available on the MAX32655, MAX32680, and MAX32690 . This option specifies the project to build for the RISC-V core when RISCV_LOAD is enabled. Must be a path relative to the project that enables RISCV_LOAD , or an absolute path. RISCV_PREFIX Change the toolchain prefix This option can be used to override the GCC toolchain prefix if needed. For example, to use the legacy RISC-V toolchain RISCV_PREFIX = riscv-none-embed will attempt to compile with riscv-none-embed-gcc . Build Variables for Toggling Libraries The following variables can be used to enable the available libraries in the MSDK. Each library may also offer its own build configuration variables when enabled, which are documented in the libraries section. Configuration Variable Description Details LIB_BOARD Include the BSP library (enabled by default) Inclusion of the Board-Support Package (BSP) library, which is enabled by default, can be toggled with this variable. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_PERIPHDRIVERS Include the peripheral driver library (enabled by default) The peripheral driver library can be toggled with this option. If disabled, you'll lose access to the higher-level driver functions but still have access to the register-level files. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_CMSIS_DSP Include the CMSIS-DSP library The CMSIS-DSP library can be enabled with this option. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_CORDIO Include the Cordio library The Cordio BLE library can be included with this option. This is only applicable for microcontrollers with an integrated BLE controller. LIB_FCL Include the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL) This option toggles the Free Cryptographic Library (FCL), which is a collection of software-implemented common cryptographic functions that can be included with this option. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_FREERTOS Include the FreeRTOS library The FreeRTOS library can be enabled with this option, which is an open-source Real-Time Operating System (RTOS). Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LC3 Include the LC3 codec library This option enables the inclusion of the Low Complexity Communication Codec (LC3), which is an efficient low latency audio codec. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LITTLEFS Include the littleFS library This option toggles the \"Little File System\" library - a small filesystem library designed for microcontrollers. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_LWIP Include the lwIP library LIB_MAXUSB Include the MaxUSB library This option toggles the inclusion of the MAXUSB library, which facilitates the use of the native USB peripherals on some microcontrollers. Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. LIB_SDHC Include the SDHC library This option toggles the Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) library, which can be used to interface with SD cards. Additionally, it enables the FatFS library, which implements a generic FAT filesystem. LIB_CLI Include the MSDK's built-in CLI library This option toggles the MSDK's built-in CLI library, which can be used to process received commands over UART. Build Variables for the PeriphDrivers Library The following variables are specific to the PeriphDrivers library. Configuration Variable Description Details MXC_SPI_VERSION Set the SPI drivers to use (default is v1 ) The PeriphDrivers offer two versions of the SPI API in order to maintain backwards compatibility. Acceptable values are v1 (legacy) or v2 . See The SPI V2 Developer Note for more details. Build Variables for Secure Boot Tools (SBTs) For microcontrollers with a secure bootloader, the following build configuration variables can be used to enable integration with the Secure Boot Tools. These are a suite of applications designed for use with microcontrollers that have secure bootloaders. Configuration Variable Description Details SBT Toggle SBT integration Toggles integration with the Secure Boot Tools (SBTs) . These are a suite of applications designed for use with microcontrollers that have secure bootloaders. When this is enabled, some additional rules become available such as make sla and make scpa . Set to 0 to disable or 1 to enable. MAXIM_SBT_DIR Where to find the SBTs This option can be used to manually specify the location of the SBTs. Usually, this is not necessary. By default, the Tools/SBT directory of the MaximSDK will be searched. If the SBT installer is used, it will set the MAXIM_SBT_DIR environment variable to point to itself automatically. TARGET_SEC Secure part number to use Some secure microcontrollers have multiple secure variants, and this option can be used to specify the variant to use with the SBTs. Defaults are intelligently selected and can be found in $(MAXIM_SBT_DIR)/SBT-config.mk SCP_PACKETS Where to build the scp_packets folder Defaults to build/scp_packets TEST_KEY Which test key to sign applications with Defaults to $(MAXIM_SBT_DIR)/devices/$(TARGET_SEC)/keys/maximtestcrk.key , which is the Maxim test key that can be used for development. Build Variables Controlling the Output The following build variables can be used to control how to build output is formatted. Configuration Variable Description Details VERBOSE Toggle verbose builds Set to 1 to enable a verbose build that prints exactly what the compiler is doing for each step. This is useful for troubleshooting. FORCE_COLOR Force colorized compiler output By default, GCC will attempt to autodetect whether colorized output is supported or not. Set to 1 to force color (equivalent to PROJ_CFLAGS += -fdiagnostics-color=always ). This is useful for forcing color in CI systems. Board Support Packages The MSDK supports multiple parts and evaluation platforms (see supported parts ) through \"Board Support Packages\" (BSPs) . For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs will be available. The role of a BSP is to provide a hardware abstraction layer for the initialization and management of board-level hardware such as serial interfaces, pushbuttons, LEDs, external peripheral devices, TFT displays, etc. which will vary between evaluation platforms. The BSP abstraction layer also improves code portability to custom devices. \u2139\ufe0f Note The first task when opening or creating any project is to ensure the BSP is set correctly. How to Set the BSP To set the BSP for a project: In VS Code : How to Set the BSP (VS Code) In Eclipse : How to Set the BSP (Eclipse) Command-Line Development: How to Set the BSP (Command-Line) BSP Table Available BSPs are located in the Libraries/Boards folder for each Target Microcontroller . The name of a BSP's folder is used with the BOARD build configuration variable to build a project for a specific BSP. The table below matches the correct BOARD values to external part numbers .

Inspecting the Libraries/CMSIS/Device/Maxim/TARGET/Source/system_TARGET.c for a target microcontroller shows how the BSP is integrated into the microcontroller's startup code. For example, the MAX78000's system_max78000.c startup file shows that Board_Init is a weak function that can be overridden. Board_Init is called from the default SystemInit implementation, which can also be overridden. /* This function is called before C runtime initialization and can be * implemented by the application for early initializations. If a value other * than '0' is returned, the C runtime initialization will be skipped. * * You may over-ride this function in your program by defining a custom * PreInit(), but care should be taken to reproduce the initialization steps * or a non-functional system may result. */ __weak int PreInit(void) { /* Do nothing */ return 0; } /* This function can be implemented by the application to initialize the board */ __weak int Board_Init(void) { /* Do nothing */ return 0; } /* This function is called just before control is transferred to main(). * * You may over-ride this function in your program by defining a custom * SystemInit(), but care should be taken to reproduce the initialization * steps or a non-functional system may result. */ __weak void SystemInit(void) { /* Configure the interrupt controller to use the application vector table in */ /* the application space */ #if defined(__CC_ARM) || defined(__GNUC__) /* IAR sets the VTOR pointer incorrectly and causes stack corruption */ SCB->VTOR = (uint32_t)__isr_vector; #endif /* __CC_ARM || __GNUC__ */ /* Enable instruction cache */ MXC_ICC_Enable(MXC_ICC0); /* Enable FPU on Cortex-M4, which occupies coprocessor slots 10 and 11 */ /* Grant full access, per \"Table B3-24 CPACR bit assignments\". */ /* DDI0403D \"ARMv7-M Architecture Reference Manual\" */ SCB->CPACR |= SCB_CPACR_CP10_Msk | SCB_CPACR_CP11_Msk; __DSB(); __ISB(); SystemCoreClockUpdate(); Board_Init(); } A custom BSP can implement one or all of the weak functions. The file structure for a typical BSP can be found below. The board.mk file is required , while the rest of the project structure is a recommendation. CustomBSP (defines BOARD value) \u251c\u2500 board.mk (required file!) \u251c\u2500 Include | \u2514\u2500 board.h \u2514\u2500 Source \u2514\u2500 board.c The name of the BSP's root folder will be the string used with the BOARD build configuration variable to select it for a project. In the example above, one would use BOARD = CustomBSP to select it as the active BSP. BSP Search Directory By default, the MSDK searches for BSPs in the Libraries/Boards folder for each microcontroller. This can be changed using the BSP_SEARCH_DIR build configuration variable , which allows users to load a BSP from a directory outside of the MSDK. The MSDK also uses the BOARD variable in its search path. For example, the configuration... # project.mk BSP_SEARCH_DIR = /home/username/mybsps # ^ \"root\" of the BSP search path BOARD = CustomBSP # \"stem\" of the BSP search path ... will attempt to load the /home/username/msbsps/CustomBSP/board.mk file. Custom BSP Template The following contents can be used as a bare-bones starter template for a custom BSP. board.h // board.h #define BOARD_CUSTOM // ^ This type of compiler definition is // sometimes useful. It allows application code // to check if a specific BSP is being used. // Ex: #ifdef BOARD_CUSTOM // ... // #endif /** * \\brief Initialize the BSP and board interfaces. * \\returns #E_NO_ERROR if everything is successful */ int Board_Init(void); board.c //board.c #include \"board.h\" #include \"mxc_error.h\" int Board_Init(void) { // Implement me! return E_NO_ERROR; } board.mk # board.mk ifeq \"$(BOARD_DIR)\" \"\" # This Makefile will self-locate if BOARD_DIR is not specified. BOARD_DIR := $(dir $(abspath $(lastword $(MAKEFILE_LIST)))) endif SRCS += board.c VPATH += $(BOARD_DIR)/Source IPATH += $(BOARD_DIR)/Include Disabling BSPs It should also be noted that BSP integration can be disabled entirely by setting the LIB_BOARD build configuration variable to 0. This will skip the inclusion of the BSP's board.mk file entirely, and the default system initialization functions will be used. This option can also be used to implement a custom BSP inside of a project's application code. For example, a user could implement Board_Init inside of a project's main.c file without having to create a separate BSP folder with LIB_BOARD = 0 . project.mk # project.mk LIB_BOARD = 0 main.c // main.c int Board_Init(void) { // Implement me! return E_NO_ERROR; } int main(void) { Board_Init(); // ... } Libraries The MSDK contains a large number of libraries, both third-party and in-house. The main library is the Peripheral Driver API , but the MSDK also contains drivers for various external components such as TFT displays, cameras, accelerometers, audio codecs, and other devices. Additionally, dedicated libraries for more complex internal hardware peripherals such as USB, the SDHC interface, and the Cordio BLE stack are also available. These usually build on top of the Peripheral Driver API. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Enabling Libraries Libraries can be enabled for a project with a convenient toggle switch provided by the build system (See Build Variables for Toggling Libraries )). Peripheral Driver API A microcontroller is made up of a Central Processing Unit (CPU) that is surrounded by additional peripheral hardware blocks such as timers, memory controllers, UART controllers, ADCs, RTCs, audio interfaces, and many more. The Peripheral Driver API is an important core library in the MSDK that allows the CPU to utilize the microcontroller's hardware blocks over a higher-level Application Programming Interface (API) . API Documentation (PeriphDrivers) The links below will open detailed API references for each microcontroller. Offline copies of these API references can also be found in the Documentation folder of the MSDK installation. MAX32520 API MAX32650 API MAX32655 API MAX32660 API MAX32665-MAX32666 API MAX32670 API MAX32672 API MAX32675 API MAX32680 API MAX32690 API MAX78000 API MAX78002 API PeriphDrivers Organization The Peripheral Driver API's source code is organized as follows: Header files (.h) can be found in the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Include folder. These files contain function declarations for the API, describing the function prototypes and their associated documentation. Source files (.c) can be found in the Libraries/PeriphDrivers/Source folder. These files contain the function definitions for the API - the implementations of the functions declared by the header files. The implementation files are further organized based on die type and hardware revision . This is worth noting when browsing or debugging through the drivers. The die type files follow the _ESXX , _MEXX , or _AIXX naming convention. These files' responsibility is to manage microcontroller-specific implementation details that may interact with other peripheral APIs before ultimately calling the revision-specific files. See Die Types to Part Numbers The hardware revision files follow the _revX naming convention. These files contain the pure driver implementation for a peripheral block and typically interact with the hardware almost entirely at the register level. Die Types to Part Numbers The following table matches external part numbers to internal die types. This is useful for browsing through the PeriphDrivers source code, which uses the die types. \u2139\ufe0f Note: Die Types Table Part Number Die Type MAX32520 ES17 MAX32570 ME13 MAX32650 ME10 MAX32655 ME17 MAX32660 ME11 MAX32662 ME12 MAX32665 ME14 MAX32670 ME15 MAX32672 ME21 MAX32675 ME16 MAX32680 ME20 MAX32690 ME18 MAX78000 AI85 MAX78002 AI87 CMSIS-DSP The CMSIS-DSP library provides a suite of common Digital Signal Processing (DSP) functions that take advantage of hardware accelerated Floating Point Unit (FPU) available on microcontrollers with Arm Cortex-M cores. This library is distributed in the MSDK as a pre-compiled static library file, and the MSDK maintains a port of the official code examples in the ARM-DSP Examples folder for each microcontroller. Please refer to the CMSIS-DSP official documentation for more detailed documentation on the library functions and usage. CMSIS-DSP Supported Parts All microcontrollers with a Cortex M4 core are supported. Cordio Bluetooth Low Energy The Cordio Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) library provides a full BLE stack for microcontrollers with an integrated BLE controller. The Cordio library warrants its own separate documentation. See the Cordio BLE User Guide . Cordio Supported Parts MAX32655 MAX32665 MAX32680 MAX32690 MAXUSB The MAXUSB library provides a higher-level interface for utilizing the built-in USB controller hardware available on some microcontrollers. This allows the microcontroller to enumerate as a USB device without the need for an external USB controller IC. MAXUSB Supported Parts MAX32570 MAX32650 MAX32655 and MAX32656 MAX32665-MAX32666 MAX32690 MAX78002 Miscellaneous Drivers The Libraries/MiscDrivers folder of the MSDK contains drivers for miscellaneous external components such as TFT displays, cameras, audio codecs, PMICs, pushbuttons, etc. These resources are usually closely tied with the Board Support Packages . Miscellaneous Build Variables Configuration Variable Description Details CAMERA (Optional) Set the Camera drivers to use This option is only useful for the MAX78000 and MAX78002 and sets the camera drivers to use for the project. Permitted values are HM01B0 , HM0360_MONO , HM0360_COLOR , OV5642 , OV7692 (default), or PAG7920 . Camera drivers can be found in the Libraries/MiscDrivers/Camera folder. Depending on the selected camera, a compiler definition may be added to the build. See the board.mk file for the active BSP for more details. SDHC The Secure Digital High Capacity (SDHC) library offers a higher-level interface built on top of the SDHC Peripheral Driver API that includes a FatFS File System implementation for managing files on SD cards. See Build Variables for Toggling Libraries for instructions on enabling the SDHC library. SDHC Supported Parts MAX32650 MAX32570 MAX32665-MAX32666 MAX78000 MAX78002 SDHC Build Variables Once enabled, the following build configuration variables become available. Configuration Variable Description Details FATFS_VERSION Specify the version of FatFS to use FatFS is a generic FAT/exFAT filesystem that comes as a sub-component of the SDHC library. This variable can be used to change the version to use. Acceptable values are ff13 (R0.13), ff14 (R0.14b), or ff15 (R0.15) SDHC_CLK_FREQ Sets the clock freq. for the SDHC library (Hz) Sets the target clock frequency in units of Hz (Default is 30Mhz). Reducing the SDHC clock frequency is a good troubleshooting step when debugging communication issues. FreeRTOS FreeRTOS is a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), which offers basic abstractions for multi-tasking and an OS layer specifically targeted at embedded systems with real-time requirements. The MSDK maintains an official support layer for the FreeRTOS kernel. Official documentation can be found on the FreeRTOS website . FreeRTOS Supported Parts FreeRTOS is supported by all parts in the MSDK. See the FreeRTOSDemo example application. FreeRTOS-Plus FreeRTOS-Plus is an additional library that implements addon functionality for the FreeRTOS kernel. The MSDK maintains support for some, but not all, available addons. FreeRTOS-Plus-CLI : Supported FreeRTOS-Plus-TCP : Not supported (Contributions welcome!) CLI Developing a UART Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a common task while developing embedded firmware. The MSDK contains a pre-made command processing library in the Libraries/CLI that can be used to simplify and speed up development. See the Libraries/CLI/README.md document for more details. CoreMark EEMBC\u2019s CoreMark\u00ae is a benchmark that measures the performance of microcontrollers (MCUs) and central processing units (CPUs) used in embedded systems. CoreMark is a simple, yet sophisticated benchmark that is designed specifically to test the functionality of a processor core. Running CoreMark produces a single-number score allowing users to make quick comparisons between processors. CoreMark Supported Parts All parts in the MSDK support the Coremark library via a Coremark example application. \u2139\ufe0f Note The source code of the Coremark examples are somewhat unique. They only contain a core_portme.c / core_portme.h . These files are provided by CoreMark libraries to give the MSDK an implementation layer for a few hardware-dependent functions. Otherwise, the remainder of the source code (located in Libraries/Coremark ) must remain unmodified to comply with the CoreMark rules. Examples The MSDK contains examples for each microcontroller that demonstrate the usage of its Peripheral APIs and other supported libraries. They can be found in the Examples folder of an MSDK installation. \u26a0\ufe0f Copying Examples It's strongly recommended to copy example projects to an outside folder before modifying them. This keeps the MSDK's \"source\" copy preserved for reference. Project folders must be copied to a location without any spaces in its filepath. Each example contains a README.md file describing what it does. In general, there is at least one example per peripheral block, and the example's name will indicate what it matches (i.e., DMA , ADC , SPI ). The tables below are offered to facilitate easier browsing through the MSDK examples. They are autogenerated from the available projects for each microcontroller. A link to the example's source code on Github is available, as well as its location inside of the MSDK. Common Examples The following common examples are supported across multiple microcontrollers.

These limitations may make the device difficult (or impossible) for the debugger to connect in certain states. In such cases, the device can attempt to be recovered using a MAX32625PICO . See How to Unlock a Microcontroller That Can No Longer Be Programmed A debugger can not be connected to a microcontroller while the device is in reset. A microcontroller can not be debugged while it's Sleep , Low Power Mode , Micro Power Mode , Standby , Backup , or Shutdown mode. These modes shut down the SWD clock. For low-power development, it's recommended to place a 2-second blocking delay at the start of main . MAX32625PICO (PICO) A MAX32625PICO (affectionately called the \"PICO\") debug adapter is provided with almost all the evaluation platforms supported by the MSDK. Additionally, most small form-factor evaluation kits have a PICO embedded into the PCB. It's good practice to update the PICO's firmware to the latest version, which can be found on the MAX32625PICO Firmware Images Github page. Updating the MAX32625PICO (PICO) Debug Adapter Firmware Download the correct image for your evaluation platform from the MAX32625PICO Firmware Images Github page. Connect the included micro-USB cable to the PICO without connecting the other side of the cable to your host PC yet. Press and hold the pushbutton on the top of the PICO. While holding down the pushbutton on the PICO connect the other side of the micro-USB cable to your host PC. Keep the pushbutton held down until the LED on the PICO blinks and becomes solid. A MAINTENANCE drive should now appear on your file system. Drag and drop the downloaded file from step 1 onto the MAINTENANCE drive. This will flash the PICO with the updated firmware. Once the flashing is complete, the PICO will restart and present itself as a DAPLINK drive. Open the DAPLINK drive. Open the DETAILS.TXT file and verify the Git SHA matches the expected value for the updated file. Your PICO debugger is now ready to use with the latest firmware. How to Unlock a Microcontroller That Can No Longer Be Programmed The debug limitations of the MSDK's supported parts may make some devices difficult to connect to if bad firmware has been flashed. In such cases, the device can attempt to be recovered from the \u201clocked out\u201d firmware by mass erasing the application code from the flash memory bank. Note that this does not always work. Success will depend on a small window being available for the debugger to connect immediately after reset. Before following the procedure below, ensure that you have updated the PICO debugger firmware to the latest version. See Updating the MAX32625PICO (PICO) Debug Adapter Firmware Unlock with VS Code For VS Code users, the \"erase flash\" build task can be used to attempt a mass erase. If this task fails to recover the part, attempt the procedure below. Unlock with erase.act Connect the PICO debugger to the microcontroller to recover. Connect the PICO debugger to the host PC with the included micro-USB cable. Open the DAPLINK` drive on the host PC. Open the DETAILS.TXT inside of the DAPLINK drive in a text editor. Verify that the \u201cAutomation allowed\u201d field is set to 1. \u2139\ufe0f Enabling Automation If this field is not set to 1, follow the procedure below: Create a new empty file, and save it as auto_on.cfg . Press and hold the pushbutton on top of the PICO. While holding the pushbutton , drag and drop the auto_on.cfg file onto the DAPLINK drive. Continue holding the pushbutton until the file is finished transferring over, then release it. The PICO should power cycle, and the DAPLINK drive should re-appear with \u201cAutomation allowed\u201d set to 1. Power on the evaluation platform (if it isn\u2019t already). Create an empty file called erase.act . Drag and drop the erase.act file onto the DAPLINK drive. The PICO debugger will attempt to mass erase the microcontroller's flash bank, which will completely wipe any application firmware that is programmed on the device. \u2139\ufe0f Note If this process fails, a FAIL.TXT file will be present in the DAPLINK drive with an additional error message inside of it. A failure is generally indicative of firmware that has completely shut down the debug port, or has entered low power loop immediately on power-up. In these cases, it's not possible to recover the device. Power cycle the microcontroller. It step 8 succeeded, it's blank and ready to re-program. The debugger should have no issues connecting to the device in this blank state. Developer Notes SPI v2 Library The SPI v2 Library is the latest version of the MSDK SPI drivers which highlights: Target Select (TS) Control Scheme which provides users the option to drive their own TS pins. Optional MXC_SPI_Config(...) and mxc_spi_cfg_t struct to reduce the use of multiple functions to select proper SPI settings. Re-mapped the MXC_SPI_Init(...) function input parameters (same behavior as SPI v1). Allow for re-arming an SPI transaction within the callback function for chained SPI messages. Decrease in setup overhead in a Transaction function call. Less nested function calls within drivers. Improved SPI DMA support and DMA Channel IRQ vector flexibility by providing acquired DMA channel numbers before a SPI DMA transaction call. The use of Controller and Target terms instead of Master and Slave, respectively. Still supports SPI v1 function prototypes for backwards-compatibility. Bug fixes from the SPI v1 API. Porting Projects to use SPI v2 The latest SPI examples in the MSDK defaults to build the SPI v1 libraries. Set the MXC_SPI_VERSION build configuration variable to v2 (case sensitive) use the SPI v2 API. This guide shows how to update an existing project that is using the SPI v1 API to SPI v2. The SPI v2 Library still supports the SPI v1 function prototypes for backwards-compatibility with the main difference being the SPI DMA interrupt handling (see SPI DMA Interrupt Handling section below for more info). Note: The SPI v2 API is only a drop in replacement to SPI v1 if SPI DMA is not used; should the user choose to continue building with the SPI v1 convention but with the underlying SPI v2 implementation. This porting guide demonstrates how to use the full extent of the SPI v2 features. SPI Init Function The input parameters for the MXC_SPI_Init(...) function were updated in SPI v2 to allow for more user-selectable options during initialization. This should not cause any errors or behavioral differences with the MXC_SPI_Init(...) function when switching between SPI v1 and SPI v2 builds as the input parameters were essentially re-mapped to more descriptive names. SPI v1: int MXC_SPI_Init(mxc_spi_regs_t *spi, int masterMode, int quadModeUsed, int numSlaves, unsigned ssPolarity, unsigned int hz, mxc_spi_pins_t pins) SPI v2: int MXC_SPI_Init(mxc_spi_regs_t *spi, mxc_spi_type_t controller_target, mxc_spi_interface_t if_mode, int numTargets, uint8_t ts_active_pol_mask, uint32_t freq, mxc_spi_pins_t pins) Input Parameters: mxc_spi_regs_t *spi remains unchanged. int masterMode -> mxc_spi_type_t controller_target . The enum mxc_spi_type_t was added for increased code readability. int quadModeUsed -> mxc_spi_interface_t if_mode . Previously, the MXC_SPI_Init(...) function could only select between standard (4wire) and quad interface modes. With SPI v2, the user can select either standard ( MXC_SPI_INTERFACE_STANDARD ), quad ( MXC_SPI_INTERFACE_QUAD ), 3wire ( MXC_SPI_INTERFACE_3WIRE ), or dual ( MXC_SPI_INTERFACE_DUAL ) mode. int numSlaves -> int numTargets . SPI v2 does not use this parameter and was kept to continue supporting SPI v1. unsigned ssPolarity -> uint8_t ts_active_pol_mask . Updated to a more descriptive name. unsigned int hz -> uint32_t freq . mxc_spi_pins_t pins remains unchanged. SPI Config Function The int MXC_SPI_Config(mxc_spi_cfg_t cfg) function was added to reduce the number of helper function calls to set the appropriate settings that the MXC_SPI_Init(...) function did not set. This function also sets up the DMA and acquires DMA TX/RX channels for SPI DMA transactions. mxc_spi_cfg_t struct: mxc_spi_regs_t *spi - Select SPI Instance to configure. mxc_spi_clkmode_t clk_mode - Select clock mode. uint8_t frame_size - Select single frame size (2 - 16 bits). bool use_dma_tx - Enable SPI DMA TX (acquire and configure TX channel). bool use_dma_rx - Enable SPI DMA RX (acquire and configure RX channel). mxc_dma_regs_t *dma - Select DMA Instance to configure for SPI DMA (Valid only if use_dma_tx or use_dma_rx is set to true). SPI Request Struct mxc_spi_req_t struct: mxc_spi_regs_t *spi - Remains unchanged. int ssIdx - Remains unchanged. int ssDeassert - Remains unchanged. uint8_t *txData - Remains unchanged. uint8_t *rxData - Remains unchanged. uint32_t txLen - Remains unchanged. uint32_t rxLen - Remains unchanged. uint32_t txCnt - Not used in SPI v2. uint32_t rxCnt - Not used in SPI v2. mxc_spi_callback_t completeCB - Type was renamed, but funtionally, remains unchanged. SPI Transaction Functions The SPI v2 Libraries follows the terms used in the user guide: Controller and Target instead of Master and Slave, respectively. MXC_SPI_MasterTransaction(...) -> MXC_SPI_ControllerTransaction(...) MXC_SPI_MasterTransactionAsync(...) -> MXC_SPI_ControllerTransactionAsync(...) MXC_SPI_MasterTransactionDMA(...) -> MXC_SPI_ControllerTransactionDMA(...) MXC_SPI_SlaveTransaction(...) -> MXC_SPI_TargetTransaction(...) MXC_SPI_SlaveTransactionAsync(...) -> MXC_SPI_TargetTransactionAsync(...) MXC_SPI_SlaveTransactionDMA(...) -> MXC_SPI_TargetTransactionDMA(...) SPI DMA Setup for MXC_SPI_ControllerTransactionDMA(...) The SPI v2 library allows for more flexibility in setting generic DMA TX/RX channel vectors for SPI DMA transactions during run-time. Compared to SPI v1 where the user must know the acquired SPI DMA TX/RX channel numbers and define the appropriate DMA channel handlers before compile-time. There are two ways to initialize and configure the DMA before starting a SPI DMA transaction. Method 1: Call int MXC_SPI_DMA_Init(mxc_spi_regs_t *spi, mxc_dma_regs_t *dma, bool use_dma_tx, bool use_dma_rx) . Method 2: Set up the DMA options in the mxc_spi_cfg_t struct and call int MXC_SPI_Config(mxc_spi_cfg_t cfg) . ... // Initialize SPI DMA ahead of time. MXC_SPI_DMA_Init(SPI, DMA, true, true); int TX_DMA_CH = MXC_SPI_DMA_GetTXChannel(SPI); int RX_DMA_CH = MXC_SPI_DMA_GetRXChannel(SPI); NVIC_EnableIRQ(MXC_DMA_CH_GET_IRQ(TX_DMA_CH)); NVIC_EnableIRQ(MXC_DMA_CH_GET_IRQ(RX_DMA_CH)); MXC_NVIC_SetVector(MXC_DMA_CH_GET_IRQ(TX_DMA_CH), DMA_TX_IRQHandler); MXC_NVIC_SetVector(MXC_DMA_CH_GET_IRQ(RX_DMA_CH), DMA_RX_IRQHandler); MXC_SPI_ControllerTransactionDMA(&req); ... The DMA is initialized in MXC_SPI_DMA_Init(...) or MXC_SPI_Config(...) . This provides information on what DMA channels were acquired for a SPI instance's TX and RX DMA before calling the DMA transaction function. Following the example above, it is recommended to set up a generic-named DMA TX/RX vector because the SPI TX and RX DMA channels won't always acquire DMA_CH0 and DMA_CH1, respectively. SPI DMA Interrupt Handling void DMA_TX_IRQHandler(void) { MXC_SPI_DMA_TX_Handler(SPI); } void DMA_RX_IRQHandler(void) { MXC_SPI_DMA_RX_Handler(SPI); } The SPI v1 API requires MXC_DMA_Handler() to be called in the TX and RX DMA Channel interrupt handlers. Following the generic vector names used in the previous section, the SPI v2 supplies its own TX/RX DMA Handler processing functions ( MXC_SPI_DMA_RX_Handler(...) and MXC_SPI_DMA_RX_Handler(...) ) that must be called within their appropriate DMA channel interrupt handlers.","title":"MSDK User Guide"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#msdk-user-guide","text":"","title":"MSDK User Guide"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#overview","text":"The Maxim Microcontrollers SDK (MSDK), now a part of Analog Devices , contains the necessary software and tools to develop firmware for the MAX32xxx and MAX78xxx Microcontrollers .

There are also some manual setup steps required to retrieve make version 4. The instructions in this section are critical. \u2139\ufe0f Instructions for M1 platforms The MSDK's OpenOCD binaries ship pre-compiled for Intel Silicon (i386). As a result, you should use a Rosetta terminal on M1 platforms to install the i386 version of Homebrew and retrieve OpenOCD's dependencies with it. Installing from Rosetta ensures OpenOCD gets the packages with the architecture it needs. From there, Rosetta will handle the rest and allow running the binaries on the M1 platform's arm64 architecture. Additionally, the MSDK toolchain requires Make 4.x+, which must also be retrieved via Homebrew. The i386 version of Homebrew can be installed in parallel with the arm64 version and typically installs into a separate filesystem. Open a terminal and update Rosetta. softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license Close the terminal. Create a new Rosetta terminal: Launch Finder. Navigate to Applications and find the \"Terminal\" application. Right-Click Terminal and Duplicate it. Rename it to \"Terminal i386\". This will be a new application shortcut to the Rosetta terminal. Right-Click \"Terminal i386\" > Get Info > Enable \"Open using Rosetta\" Launch the new \"Terminal i386\" and type arch to verify that it says i386 now. From your Rosetta terminal, follow the instructions on the Homebrew home page to install Homebrew on your system. Verify the correct version of Homebrew is running from your Rosetta terminal using the which brew command. This command should return a path beginning with /usr/local . Note: On systems with multiple or pre-existing Homebrew installations, the arm64 version of Homebrew may still take precedence over the newly installed x86_64 version. If which brew contains /opt/homebrew instead, you may need to edit your terminal profile's startup script. Alternatively, you can directly run the correct Homebrew binary using its absolute path. Run the command brew install make libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb (or, if you need to use the absolute path) /usr/local/homebrew/bin/brew make install libusb-compat libftdi hidapi libusb The MSDK toolchain is dependent on GNU make 4.x+ being available as make , but Homebrew will install it as gmake .

The typical evaluation cycle usually involves setting up the development environment, running demos, and exercising the peripheral driver API on an evaluation platform . The typical development cycle typically involves building a prototype application on an evaluation platform first, then porting the application to a custom board. This section describes how to get started with the MSDK focusing on the evaluation cycle. First , review the Key Concepts below. Then, proceed to the section for your preferred IDE. Each sub-section is written as a self-contained quick-start with links to additional documentation on important topics.

There are a few key concepts to remember that are universal to MSDK development. Target Microcontroller : The target microcontroller refers to the base part number of the microcontroller used for development. The MSDK contains register-level support and startup files for each of its supported parts , and it's important to note that support files for a target microcontroller and its Board Support Packages are distinct from each other. For example, if the MAX78000EVKIT or MAX78000FTHR is being used, the Target Microcontroller is the MAX78000. Board Support Package (BSP) : The MSDK supports evaluation platforms for target microcontrollers with Board Support Packages . For microcontrollers with multiple evaluation platforms, multiple BSPs are available. These can be found in the Libraries/Boards folder of the MSDK installation. By default, most projects in the MSDK come pre-configured for the \"EVKIT\"-type BSP, which is generally the largest evaluation platform for that device with most (or all) pins broken out. It's important to note that the active BSP may need to be reconfigured for a project, which is done slightly differently for each development environment. System Environment : Your system's environment is a broad term that encapsulates the programs and variables available to your system's shell on the command line. The user is expected to have some basic familiarity with this concept. System Path : Your system's Path is a unique environment variable that tells it where to search for program binaries. The user is expected to be familiar with this concept and how to modify the system Path if necessary. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) : An IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) that manages the tools for editing source code, building source code, flashing program binaries, and debugging . The abbreviation is frequently used in this document, and the MSDK supports multiple IDEs that can be used depending on preference. (See \"Supported Development Environments\" ) Build Configuration vs. Project Configuration : An MSDK project is comprised of two complementary systems: The Build System and the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) . These systems each offer their own configuration interfaces, and it's important to note what each is used for. The Build System manages source code compilation into program binaries and offers a Command-Line Interface (CLI) for setting Build Configuration Variables . The IDE offers a higher-level user interface (typically with a GUI) for managing a project and sits on top of the build system's CLI . Each IDE offers its own settings for managing fundamental aspects of the build, such as: Setting the Target Microcontroller Setting the Board Support Package Configuring the Environment and System Path for use with the MSDK toolchain","title":"Key Concepts"},{"location":"USERGUIDE/#getting-started-with-visual-studio-code","text":"The MSDK includes Visual Studio Code (\"VS Code\") support through the VSCode-Maxim project.

A command-line interface or command language interpreter (CLI), also known as command-line user interface, console user interface, and character user interface (CUI), is a means of interacting with an embedded system where the user (or client) issues commands to the program in the form of successive lines of text (command lines). This library provides an extensible command processor to: Quickly and easily wrap user functions with a CLI Allow developers to get diagnostics and change device parameters interactively Easily automate testing of the device, through PC-side scripting The current CLI Library includes the following features: UART interface support Custom commands with support for multiple arguments No modification of functions required. Users implement a command table and simple wrapper functions. Case insensitive commands & arguments. White-space insensitive. Easy built-in 'help' command and custom help strings. Usage Guide To use the CLI library, users are expected to implement the following steps in their application: Add the following line to your project.mk file to enable the CLI library for your project: LIB_CLI = 1 #include \"cli.h\" in your application code. Define an array of type const command_t . This is your command table. Include an array element for each command you want your CLI to support. Each element should define: The name of the command A string showing how to enter the command in the terminal A description of what the command does A function pointer to a wrapper function. For example, the following is subset of the SDHC example command set: const command_t user_commands[] = {{ \"format\", \"format\", \"Format the Card\", handle_format }, { \"mkdir\", \"mkdir <directory name>\", \"Create a directory\", handle_mkdir }} Implement a handler function for each command. The handler functions provided to the user_commands table are \"wrappers\" around the code that should be run for each received command. The handlers must conform to the following definition: Parameters int argc - This tells the handler function how many arguments were received. char* argv[] - This array holds the received arguments (in order) as strings. (Note: argv[0] holds the command string, argv[1:argc] are the arguments (if any are passed), and the last element in the argument vector is always a NULL pointer.) Return Value The function needs to return an integer type. It should return 0 (E_NO_ERROR) if the command was executed successfuly, otherwise it should return a negative integer as an error code. Below is a sample handler function for a \"make directory\" command, where mkdir is some function in the user's application code that does the work. int handle_mkdir(int argc, char *argv[]) { mkdir(argv[1]); } As an example, suppose a user entered the command: mkdir new_folder The CLI library will tokenize the command string \"mkdir new_folder\" into \"mkdir\" and \"new_folder\" and assigns them to argv[0] and argv[1] respectively. The library would then determine that this is the \"make directory\" command and would call \"handle_mkdir\" with argc=2 and a pointer to the argument vector. Add a call to MXC_CLI_Init to the application's startup code. Pass in the UART instance for the CLI to use, a pointer to the command table, and the number of commands in the command table. (OPTIONAL) The CLI library will enable and handle UART interrupts automatically. Users who would like more control over the interrupt handling have the option to disable the default handler and define their own. To do so, set the LIB_CLI_USE_DEFAULT_HANDLER build configuration variable to 0 . Users may now enable and handle the interrupt with a custom function.

It is a simple peripheral application that will allow you to advertise and connect with a central device such as a smartphone. Follow the MSDK User Guide instructions to install the necessary tools and create a new project. Build and run the BLE_periph application for the appropriate target. Building Most of the source code will be built in a library that can be shared between applications. Different variants will be built based on settings in project.mk . # Cordio library options # This will include the Bluetooth Host portions of the stack in the build. BLE_HOST = 1 # This will include the Bluetooth Controller portions of the stack in the build. BLE_CONTROLLER = 1 # Typical system on chip devices will typically include both the Host and the Controller. # Applications for lower level testing will only include the Controller, and use an HCI # interface to communicate with an external Host. # Peripheral devices will be typical for micro controllers and mobile, battery powered devices # These devices will advertise and can be connected to central devices.

For the latest core specification, refer to the documentation page. This will be your best resource for learning the details of Bluetooth Low Energy. These books are also excellent references for developers. Getting Started with Bluetooth Low Energy by O'Reilly Bluetooth Low Energy: The Developer's Handbook by Robin Heydon Architecture The Bluetooth stack closely resembles the layers of the network stack. We have the application layer at the top and the physical layer at the bottom. Each layer encapsulates the data and passes it to the appropriate section of the upper and lower layers. The Host Controller Interface (HCI) is the common point where devices are split. Typically this interface is over an asynchronous protocol such as UART. Some devices will define proprietary interfaces between the application and host layers. Multi-core SOCs can also use the HCI or proprietary interfaces to split the stack between multiple CPUs. Test equipment will have a USB interface and act as a Host device when testing the Controller layers. Devices under test will use a USB to UART adapter and act as Controller devices. States These are the common states used in Bluetooth LE communication. Typically devices will be in only one of these states at a time, but it is possible for devices to be in all simultaneously. Advertising Devices in this state are broadcasting advertisement packets to scanning/initiating devices. This is an asynchronous operation that has no synchronization with peer devices. Advertising devices transmit without any previous knowledge of peer devices. Advertising and scanning operations are done on channels 37, 38, and 39. The interval between advertising events is configurable between 20 ms and 10.24 s. Scanning / Initiating Devices in the scanning state listen for advertising devices and can send scan optionally requests for additional information. The scanning interval and window settings are configurable. If a device is scanning with the intent of connecting to a specific device, that is called the initiating state. The initiating devices will send a connection indication to the desired advertising device to indicate its desire to create a connection. Connected Once an initiating device sends the connection request and the advertising device accepts the connection request, the two devices enter the connected state. This is a point-to-point connection allowing devices to exchange information directly. In order to minimize interference, devices in the connected state will hop between channels 0-36 in a pseudo-random order. The channel hopping information is communicated in the connection indication. Each connection event is separated by the connection interval. This interval is configurable from 7.5 ms to 4 s. The master will always transmit first and receive second. The Slave will always receive first and transmit second. Devices will typically always send and receive at least one packet in each interval, and they can optionally transmit and receive multiple packets in each interval. Cordio Stack Architecture This document describes the Cordio software architecture. Refer to the Bluetooth specification Volume 1, Part A for additional information regarding the Bluetooth architecture. Application The App Framework performs many operations common to Bluetooth LE embedded applications, such as: Application-level device, connection, and security management. Simple user interface abstractions for button press handling, sounds, display, and other user feedback. An abstracted device database for storing bonding data and other device parameters. Profiles and Services The GATT Profile specifies the structure in which profile data is exchanged. This structure defines basic elements, such as services and characteristics, used in a profile. The top level of the hierarchy is a profile. A profile is composed of one or more services necessary to fulfill a use case. A service is composed of characteristics or references to other services. Each characteristic contains a value and may contain optional information about the value. The service and characteristic and the components of the characteristic (i.e., value and descriptors) contain the profile data and are all stored in Attributes on the server. Wireless Stack Framework The Wireless Software Foundation (WSF) is a simple OS wrapper, porting layer, and general-purpose software service used by the software system. The goal of WSF is to stay small and lean, supporting only the basic services required by the stack. It consists of the following: Event handler service with event and message passing. Timer service. Queue and buffer management service. Portable data types. Critical sections and task locking. Trace and assert diagnostic services. Security interfaces for encryption and random number generation. Platform Adaption Layer The Platform Adaption Layer is the abstraction between the software stack and the hardware. It includes APIs for timers, UART, RTC, and various system-level functions such as sleep and memory management. Attribute Protocol The ATT subsystem implements the attribute protocol and generic attribute profile (GATT). It contains two independent subsystems: The attribute protocol client (ATTC) and the attribute protocol server (ATTS). ATTC implements all attribute protocol client features and is designed to meet the client requirements of the generic attribute profile. ATTC can support multiple simultaneous connections to different servers. ATTS implements all attribute protocol server features and has support for multiple simultaneous client connections. ATTS also implements the server features defined by the generic attribute profile. Device Manager The DM subsystem implements device management procedures required by the stack. These procedures are partitioned by procedure category and device role (master or slave). The following procedures are implemented in DM: Advertising and device visibility: Enable/disable advertising, set advertising parameters and data, and set connectivity and discoverability. Scanning and device discovery: Start/stop scanning, set scan parameters, advertising reports, and name discovery. Connection management: Create/accept/remove connections, set/update connection parameters, and read RSSI. Security management: Bonding, storage of security parameters, authentication, encryption, authorization, random address management. Local device management: Initialization and reset, set local parameters, vendor-specific commands. DM procedures support the Generic Access Profile (GAP) when applicable. Security Manager Protocol The Security Manager Protocol (SMP) is the peer-to-peer protocol used to generate encryption keys and identity keys. The protocol operates over a dedicated fixed L2CAP channel. The SMP block also manages the storage of the encryption keys and identity keys and is responsible for generating random addresses and resolving random addresses to known device identities. The SMP block interfaces directly with the Controller to provide stored keys used for encryption and authentication during the encryption or pairing procedures. The SMP subsystem implements the security manager protocol. It contains two independent subsystems: The initiator (SMPI). SMPI implements the initiator features of the security manager protocol and has support for multiple simultaneous connections. The responder (SMPR). SMPR implements the responder features of the security manager protocol and has support for only one connection (by Bluetooth specification design). SMP also implements the cryptographic toolbox, which uses AES. The interface to AES is asynchronous and abstracted through WSF. SMP also implements functions to support data signing. Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol The L2CAP (Logical Link Control Adaptation Protocol) resource manager block is responsible for managing the ordering of submission of PDU fragments to the baseband and some relative scheduling between channels to ensure that L2CAP channels with QoS commitments are not denied access to the physical channel due to Controller resource exhaustion. This is required because the architectural model does not assume that a Controller has limitless buffering or that the HCI is a pipe of infinite bandwidth. L2CAP Resource Managers may also carry out traffic conformance policing to ensure that applications are submitting L2CAP SDUs within the bounds of their negotiated QoS settings. The general Bluetooth data transport model assumes well-behaved applications and does not define how an implementation is expected to deal with this problem. Host Controller Interface The HCI subsystem implements the host-controller interface specification. This specification defines commands, events, and data packets sent between a Bluetooth LE protocol stack on a host and a link layer on a controller. The HCI API is optimized to be a thin interface layer for a single-chip system. It is configurable for either a single-chip system or a traditional system with wired HCI. This reconfigurability is accomplished through a layered implementation. A core layer can be configured for either a single-chip system or wired HCI. A transport and driver layer below the core layer can be configured for different wired transports such as UART. Link Layer The link layer is responsible for the creation, modification, and release of logical links (and, if required, their associated logical transports), as well as the update of parameters related to physical links between devices. The link layer achieves this by communicating with the link layer in remote Bluetooth devices using the Link Layer Protocol (LL) in LE. The LL protocol allows the creation of new logical links and logical transports between devices when required, as well as the general control of link and transport attributes such as the enabling of encryption on the logical transport and the adapting of transmit power on the physical link. Physical Layer The PHY block is responsible for transmitting and receiving packets of information on the physical channel. A control path between the baseband and the PHY block allows the baseband block to control the timing and frequency carrier of the PHY block. The PHY block transforms a stream of data to and from the physical channel and the baseband into required formats. ADI Attach ADI Attach is a smartphone application that can be used for Bluetooth debugging and development. Scan for advertising peripherals. Connect to devices and discover profiles and services. Read and write characteristics. Subscribe to notifications. Perform over-the-air firmware updates with supporting devices. BLE-PyDex BLE-PyDex is a hardware-agnostic Bluetooth device explorer designed to aid in the development and debugging of Bluetooth applications. https://github.com/EdwinFairchild/BLE-PyDex Frequently asked questions How do I change the advertising parameters? Peripheral applications will have a static structure that contains all of the advertising parameters. If run-time changes are desired, you must call AppAdvStop() before changing the parameters and AppAdvStart() to resume. With this configuration, the device will advertise at a fast interval (300 * 0.625 = 187.5 ms) for 5 seconds. It will then advertise slowly (1600 * 0.625 = 1000 ms) indefinitely. /*! configurable parameters for advertising */ static const appAdvCfg_t datsAdvCfg = { { 5000, 0}, /*! Advertising durations in ms, 0 is infinite */ { 300, 1600} /*! Advertising intervals in 0.625 ms units */ }; How do I change the connection parameters? Only the master of the connection can change the connection parameters. Peripheral devices can request a change, but only the master can accept and set the connection parameters. Cell phones and mobile operating systems have different restrictions on connection parameters. Peripheral applications have the following structure that is used to request connection parameter updates. /* iOS connection parameter update requirements The connection parameter request may be rejected if it does not meet the following guidelines: * Peripheral Latency of up to 30 connection intervals. * Supervision Timeout from 2 seconds to 6 seconds. * Interval Min of at least 15 ms. * Interval Min is a multiple of 15 ms. * One of the following: * Interval Max at least 15 ms greater than Interval Min. * Interval Max and Interval Min both set to 15 ms. * Interval Max * (Peripheral Latency + 1) of 2 seconds or less. * Supervision Timeout greater than Interval Max * (Peripheral Latency + 1) * 3. */ /*! configurable parameters for connection parameter update */ static const appUpdateCfg_t datsUpdateCfg = { 0, /*! ^ Connection idle period in ms before attempting connection parameter update. set to zero to disable */ (15 * 8 / 1.25), /*! Minimum connection interval in 1.25ms units */ (15 * 12 / 1.25), /*! Maximum connection interval in 1.25ms units */ 0, /*! Connection latency */ 600, /*! Supervision timeout in 10ms units */ 5 /*! Number of update attempts before giving up */ }; The DmConnUpdate() function can also be used to request a connection parameter update from the peripheral or initiate one from the master. /*************************************************************************************************/ /*! * \\brief Update the connection parameters of an open connection * * \\param connId Connection identifier. * \\param pConnSpec Connection specification. * * \\return None. */ /*************************************************************************************************/ void DmConnUpdate(dmConnId_t connId, hciConnSpec_t *pConnSpec); How do I use the low-power modes? All of the applications will enter sleep mode in idle when built with DEBUG=0 . The Wireless Stack Framework (WSF) operating system will call PalSysSleep() mode when idle. With DEBUG=1 , the CPU will stay in active mode to leave the debugger enabled. To enter the lowest power states, refer to the BLE_FreeRTOS application. This will create FreeRTOS tasks for the Cordio stack and allow users to add additional tasks. Enable configUSE_TICKLESS_IDLE , and the device will enter standby mode and deep sleep between events. WARNING: The CPU debugger is disabled in sleep modes. If your application enters sleep mode directly after reset, it will be difficult to debug and reprogram. How do I send unformatted data like a UART? Unfortunately, there is no Bluetooth SIG-defined standard for this protocol. This stack has a proprietary data transfer service that is used to transmit unformatted data between devices. Refer to the BLE_dats (BLE Data Server) for the peripheral application. You can connect to this device with the BLE_datc (BLE data client) application to see simple data transmission. Refer to the BLE_dats and BLE_dats README for more information. Additional Documentation Documentation for Python tools used for Bluetooth development and debugging can be found here . Documentation for each of the supporting applications can be found below: BLE4 BLE5 FreeRTOS DAT Client/Server BLE FCC BLE Fit BLE MCS OTA Client/Server BLE Periph RF Test HCI Documentation The Host Controller Interface (HCI) is the common point where devices are split. Typically this interface is over an asynchronous protocol such as UART. Some devices will define proprietary interfaces between the application and host layers. Multi-core SOCs can also use the HCI or proprietary interfaces to split the stack between multiple CPUs.

A transport and driver layer below the core layer can be configured for different wired transports such as UART.","title":"Host Controller Interface"},{"location":"Libraries/Cordio/docs/CORDIO_USERGUIDE/#link-layer","text":"The link layer is responsible for the creation, modification, and release of logical links (and, if required, their associated logical transports), as well as the update of parameters related to physical links between devices. The link layer achieves this by communicating with the link layer in remote Bluetooth devices using the Link Layer Protocol (LL) in LE. The LL protocol allows the creation of new logical links and logical transports between devices when required, as well as the general control of link and transport attributes such as the enabling of encryption on the logical transport and the adapting of transmit power on the physical link.","title":"Link Layer"},{"location":"Libraries/Cordio/docs/CORDIO_USERGUIDE/#physical-layer","text":"The PHY block is responsible for transmitting and receiving packets of information on the physical channel.

Typically this interface is over an asynchronous protocol such as UART. Some devices will define proprietary interfaces between the application and host layers. Multi-core SOCs can also use the HCI or proprietary interfaces to split the stack between multiple CPUs. Packets All contents in the packets are formatted little endian unless stated otherwise Packet Types Packet Packet Type Command 0x01 Async Data 0x02 Sync Data 0x03 Event 0x04 Command Type The HCI command packet typically consists of an HCI command header followed by command parameters. The structure of the HCI command packet is defined in the Bluetooth specification. Here is a general overview of the HCI command packet structure: Type (1 Byte) OpCode (2 Bytes) Parameters (N Bytes) 0x01 0xXXXX ...

These examples demonstrate a simple data client and server. The intent here is to show simple unformatted data exchange between two devices. The Bluetooth specification does not define a simple data exchange protocol, similar to UART. We use a proprietary GATT service to offer this feature. The data server will advertise with a devices name of \"DATS\". The data client will scan for this device and create a connection. Once the conneciton has been created and the client completes the discovery, it will enable notificaitons and indiciations on the proprietary data serivce. This will allow the server to transmit data to the client with notifications to the proprietary data characteristic. The client can transmit data to the server by writing to the proprietary data characteristic. ADI Attach connected to DATS ARM Proprietary data service UUID: E0262760-08C2-11E1-9073-0E8AC72E1001 This is a proprietary serivce is used for simple unformatted data exchange between the server and the client. Secure data service UUID: 42FC367E-32D9-4285-87C6-339924D135BE This is another proprietary service used for secure data exchange that requires elevated levels of encryption and authentication. Devices must be paired with LE Secure Connections to enable data transfer with this service. LEDs The red LED will indicate that an error assertion has occurred. The green LED indicates CPU activity. When the LED is on, the CPU is active, when the LED is off, the CPU is in sleep mode. BLE_Dats Bluetooth data server that advertises as \"DATS\" and accepts connection requests.

The Wireless Data Exchange profile is used to transfer files from the client to the server's internal/external flash. A CRC32 value is used to check the integrity of the transferred file. Usage LEDs The red LED will indicate that an error assertion has occurred. The green LED indicates CPU activity. When the LED is on, the CPU is active, when the LED is off, the CPU is in sleep mode. Setup The Bootloader application needs to be loaded prior to loading BLE_otas application. BLE_otas will run on top of the Bootloader . The linker file included with BLE_otas application must be used to properly setup the memory sections to coincide with the Bootloader . The project.mk in this BLE_otas application in conjunction with project.mk in Bootloader determine where the expected file is stored and read from. Default configuration is to use external flash to store the transferd file before writing it to internal flash space during the update. Alternatively by changing USE_INTERNAL_FLASH ?=0 to USE_INTERNAL_FLASH ?=1 the transfered file is stored in the update space.

We can define multiple interverals, each with their own duration. In this case we will advertise at a short interval (96*0.625ms = 60ms) for 30 seconds. We will then transition to a long interval (1600*0.625 ms = 1000 ms) indefinetly. Longer advertising intervals will conserve power, but increase the latency when communicating with scanning devices or creating connections. /*! configurable parameters for advertising */ static const appAdvCfg_t periphAdvCfg = { { 30000, 0, 0 }, /*! Advertising durations in ms, 0 corresponds to infinite */ { 96, 1600, 0 } /*! Advertising intervals in 0.625 ms units */ }; Applications can also set a definite advertising duration with will cause the device to stop advertising at the end of the duation. The application can restart advertising by calling AppAdvStart(). Advertising data Applications can define the advertising data with this structure. This information will be broadcast in every advertising event. Each portion of the advertising data is defined by a length byte, a type byte, and the data. In this case we're advertising the flags that the device is discoverable and BR/EDR (Bluetooth Classic) is not supported. We're also advertising the device name \"Periph\". /*! advertising data, discoverable mode */ static const uint8_t periphAdvDataDisc[] = { /*! flags */ 2, /*! length */ DM_ADV_TYPE_FLAGS, /*!

Packets received at the HCI layer must be buffered until the entire ACL packet has been received. Once the entire ACL packet has been received, the HCI layer will send the packet to the L2CAP layer. /*************************************************************************************************/ /*! * \\brief Set the maximum reassembled RX ACL packet length.
