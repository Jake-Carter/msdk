## Description

This example captures an image using the camera (e.g. OV5640) via MIPI CSI-2 Protocol and streams either to the on-board TFT display or to your PC through the COM port. Press PB0 to capture an image once the device is ready.

Use the [utils/console.py](utils/console.py) script to grab the camera data and create a png image of the captured image. More information can be found in [utils/README.md](utils/README.md).

Ex:
```shell
$ python utils/console.py COM6

Started ImgCapture console and opened COM6
